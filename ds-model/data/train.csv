"We had a wonderful Saturday night dinner. They had a fire dancer by the beach and a music band all night. The seafood grill was good and their buttered seafood appetizers were delicious. The grilled lamb was very chewy and not edible, so I would avoid it if possible. Overall the atmosphere was great, the service was good for a packed restaurant and food tasted good.",1
Service was brilliant and the spicy and very diverse menu actually rocks!! We had around 15 pax for dinner which we had to reserve 2 days in advance cause they are so busy. They allowed us to bring our cake since we were celebrating and also hard liquor free of charge. They only sell wine and beer. There was a fire dancer who performed and we generally gave him some cash. They set up a table on the beach specially for us. Staff was friendly and accommodating.,1
"A nice bar and dining space in Colombo. We can park vehicles üöó in the roadside. You need to be careful when you cross the railroad üõ§, because it is difficult to recognize approaching trains. Foods are really tasty üòã. I would like to recommend the soft beverages here, apple üçè juice and lime juice are the best. At night, there sing üéµ gentle songs.",0
"We went there on 31st December 2021. They had arranged a special evening which included an entrance fee as well.
The restaurant ambiance was good. Our orders came without any delay.
But food was not seasoned well and not spicy at all. No enough salt and pepper. Other than that we had a good time.",1
"Nice place decorated by the natural assets. The sea view and the location is Fantastic for mind peace. Best place for romantic candle üïØ light dinners with your loved one. So many varieties of starters, Noodles, drinks and rice. Liquor also available here. Taste is so good, for the taste and the quality of the food price can be reasonable.",1
"We dropped in for a quick drink. Dirty martini was on point.  Tequila sunrise had too much of syrup in it and tasted almost like cordial. Hot butter prawns were fresh, well prepared, juicey and crunchy at the same time, well deserved 10/10. Great ambience. Sea breeze, nicely lit,  good music and everything needed for a perfect evening. Prior reservation is recommended if you'd like a table right on the beach. The garden area with Pandan trees has a nice private feel to it.",1
"Actually its a Good place for Dinner out. The dishes are delicious and tasty. No doubts on the taste. And customer handling is high.

Note : Better call them and reserve a table for your time. (Mostly it will full around 9pm)

Much recommend place.",1
"Nice spot for dinner on the beach. We had black pepper crab, grilled king prawns, and a seafood hotpot. Crab was excellent, though the prawns were not as big as one might expect. Bottled water is expensive though!",1
"It's a perfect place for a spend your friday night with your gang also it's a good place for date night with a breathtaking sea view.

In weekend and friday night specifically you can enjoy live music and dance with tiquila
All the foods are so delicious and i love their cocktails.",1
"Beautiful ambiance, right by the ocean. Waitstaff was attentive and helpful. Beachside seating limited, so we ended up sitting in a more enclosed outdoor area. Food was tasty and the live music really tied everything together",1
Went to this place to celebrate my husband's birthday .. The food is delicious .. Gives good music .. Very interesting place,1
"Established in 2013, Barracuda Seafood and Grill has rapidly emerged as one of the foremost beachside restaurants in the popular Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Beach. Most evenings will find the restaurant at full capacity, frequented by tourists and locals alike who know Barracuda for our reputation of great service, beachside views, and international cuisines. Delicious foods and friendly service from staff. Recommended for evening parties, day outs and also to celebrate your special occasions.",1
"Great place to have some delicious food. If you are looking for a drink, there's a pub at your service. This is located in marine drive between the railway and the beach. You can have a nice candle lit dinner near the beach. Went for two  pasta dishes and they were really delicious.",1
Food is above average but not so great. My friend wanted to go here but I did not like the atmosphere because all the customers were drunk. The waiters were drunk too because you can smell it when they talk. If you do not drink alcohol like me then you would not like the atmosphere . Food is spicy probably because they focus on drunk customers. I do not drink alcohol so I can taste spices very quickly.,0
So unfortunately the experience was not good. The first day I made an order and I was very impressed with the food quality and quantity. The second day I ordered and it was half size even though I ordered large. Called the restaurant and all they did was pass me from person to person and it was not resolved. So the second time the boxes were large as the order was a large but it was mostly empty.  So beware its hit and miss with quantity and quality. They lost a potential regular customer for something they could have easily fixed.,0
Not had the greatest experience at my first visit at the end of 2021. The waiter was clearly drunk and messed up our order. He even lost the debit card we used to settle the bill. We found it lying in the floor at the cashier. The food is good. It was the only reason to have good impression at the first time.,0
One of the best places for sea food delicacies. Food is delicious and place has nice ambiance. On the beach dining option is available and best during dusk. Band is there to provide live music. This place could get crowded during weekends. Price is not too expensive. Staff is friendly and efficiently provide service. Good place to chill and relax listening to music.,1
"Been coming here a lot over the past few years, the atmosphere is great, food is good  but the service not as great. The music is too loud and flat out deafening if you did close to the dealers. The biggest drawback is the pricing... it is now reficulously expensive.",0
"I ordered hot but got a stew instead, no excuses just constatation they call it hot pot. Shame on you guys.",0
"Mesmerizing sunset view
Awesome food
Romantic ambience
A must visit place",1
"Had a really bad experience ever happened. Had a dinner with a foreign well recognized professor at here. Five of us consumed 1 wine bottle, 1 lemon gin bottle and 10 extra lemon gin shots together. But the bill indicated as 40 shots. Really unprofessional service done by them. Never recommend this place anyone. If 40 shots + 750 ml by 5 person in 3 hours, would it be possible????",0
"I don‚Äôt usually give low ratings, but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Went with 6 people at 3 pm waited 25 mins and waiters ignored us for some reason even when we called. We went and talked to one of them after and they said they‚Äôre waiting for a shift change‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. So we just left after 40 mins of just sitting there‚Ä¶
This has never happened anywhere else in Sri Lanka. This was beyond the worst service I thought I had before.
Definitely won‚Äôt go back",0
"It's a generic place for team meetups but the food, service and ambience is the most basic for a beach location. They do have a byob option which is good for people who booze since what's on offer just like the food is a bit on the expensive side.",0
"Amazing food and ambience. Everything that we ordered was great. The must try from our choices were Nasi goreng, Mongolian chicken wings. However the seafood sizzler was priced on the higher side. Otherwise the overall menu was cost effective as the quantity was sufficient.",1
Good food. Booze is a bit pricey. Service is a bit slow on Friday's and saturdays due to the large crowd but overall nice place to be.,1
"A great place to relax with your friends with a few drinks and watch the sunset with your feet in the sand.

You can take your own hard liquor without having to pay corkage provided you order enough bites.

Live music most nights.",1
Clam place to enjoy the foods. Delicious foods and we can bring our own alcohol and if we buy the foods etc they won‚Äôt charge extra fee for our bottle. We would like to visit again. Well recommend,1
"Good service. Tasty food. Staff very accomodative and friendly.
(please check your chairs. As the chair I was seated broke and I landed on the sand.)",1
"Amazing place, very inviting, the ambience is very soothing given it's on the beach, and some old school music played by a live band.

I was told that they got their bar set up now so you can go for nice beer. The food is amazing as well. If you do everything visit the Barracuda, see if you can get a table out in the beach. It's pretty nice.",1
I just loved this place. Cashews is one of the best dish they serve to vegetarians. Excellent service and value for money. Weekend nights are best to hangout.,1
Horrible customer service. We sat down and ordered two drinks but the waiter just stood there trying to make us uncomfortable and get us to order something more. Then he refused to serve us and said that they will only serve two people if the bill is going to be more than 4000. His tone alone was enough for me to get up and leave.,0
"Quite a good place to have dinner with your loved ones, family and friends. They have table arranged on the open beach as well as in-house. I always prefer the open beach is it gives the feeling of a beach restaurant.

The ideal time is after 6.30 when they put on the lights which bring up the romantic mood. You can take your boose from outside as they do not have liquor. Food is average and service is not up to the expected level. The waiters kind of lazy when we go there. Had to ask a couple of time the same thing. It could be me but generally, it's a good place to spend the evening.",0
Average food. Not so worth for the price. Average washrooms. Three stars only for the friendly waiter. However some of the staff members seem to be drunk during work.,0
"Beautiful setting on the beach shade with trees. You can find various types of sea food and many other stuff here. But the cocktails were not good for us and some foods were not worth for the price.. Food was expensive. Nice place to have a chill out with friends and family.
Finally You will be surprised with bill  (Vat + Service Charge).",0
"Food, Location, Ambience is good.. I must say it was one of the worst experience in terms of making reservations..
made multiple calls back and forth to get the correct information for a group reservation.",0
"Great spot for dinner
We had good food an a good service. The staff were really friendly and helpful and the food arrived within good time. A really nice place for a relaxing dinner with the soft music playing on the background. The dish of the day which was Shanghai Style Fried Noodles with chicken was amazing !.A must try. I definitely recommend this place.",1
Good place to have a chilled beer or hard liquor. Location is good and they have nice outdoor seating. Also you can enjoy their meals too. Bit expensive but food and bites are really good,1
Love the experience. The band was amazing.,1
Lovely location next to the Dehiwala beach. Clean & tasty food. Bit expensive but great service & excellent location to go with family too.,1
"Delicious dishes!!
Located right along the Indian beach.Open Dining to feel the sea free while enjoy the sand under feets.

Best location to have drinks from lich and night time.

Indoor dining area also available with conditioned space.

Live music programs are arranged by the management regularly.

Dishes are costed from 200SLR onwards
Average small dishes are started from 400-800 SLR for various items.

Bottles prices also reasonable.

Highly recommended.Advance booking also possible.

Card payment is also accepted.

Car park can be made right along the newly opened marine drive.",1
Great place to have meals. Space available for small gatherings. Sea Food is excellent üëåservice is quality üëç‚ú®,1
Barracuda is a well known beach side restaurant in Colombo. We went on a Poya day evening so they didn‚Äôt have any liquor options. But their mock tails were good. I highly recommend their hot butter cuttlefish. It was so yummy üòã This is a nice place to watch the sun set while zipping a beer. The restaurant start getting crowded after 6.30 or 7 in the evening. Prices are reasonable but staff wasn‚Äôt  fully attending to serve us and we had to give them reminders,1
"Lovely place to have your dinner with your family and friends. Very taste and very hot food, mainly the mixed grill sea food is great. You can bring your own alcohol bottle and use it in the restaurant without any charge. Good sea food variety is available.  Price are reasonable. Very friendly service. View is very good (on the beach). Highly recommended.",1
"Undoubtedly one of the best beach side restuarants in town. Location itself has a great ambiance, specially at night. They have seating inside and outside under the shade of mangroves as well as out in the beach with calming sea breeze. This place is ideal for a hangout and have a drink.
Service at barracuda is top notch owing to the wonderful staff who are friendly and attentive. Service is fast too.
Their menu is pretty extensive and all the dishes we tried were absolutely great while hot butter cuttlefish which was crispy and crunchy, not too spicy and fried to perfection here stands out from the rest as the best. Similarly hot butter prawns, devilled pork and indonesian style chicken accompanied by a creamy gravy was pretty good too. Rice and noodles dishes didnt have any artificial flavours so their taste was enhanced with the other dishes we tried. Sizzling Mixed meat grill and sea food grill were worth the price as they contained plenty of items in it. Judging from the portion size,quality and taste the dishes were absolutely worth the price.",1
"Excellent place that i have visited. The hotel outside covered with trees and we can sit and have fun under those trees. We'll have functions, parties on this hotel. There we can arrange tables on the seashore too. We could see the sun set at the evening time very clear.",1
"Date: 10/4/2021. Time: evening around 5:30pm. Yesterday, we had a disappointing experience at Barracuda Restaurant. We were planning to spend the entire night at Barracuda upon seeing the pictures, until the moment we left as soon as we experience a bad time. Not just the service was very slow, we were mislead by the servers to think that the Mixed Grill plater will have plenty of meat items. Unfortunately, when the food arrived, it was barely enough for 1 person because it had 1 sausage, couple of small pieces of liver, 1 half boiled egg and other burnt meat underneath which we couldn't figure out what it was and the half of the plater was covered in vegetables.

We immediately requested the manager at that it was around 6:30 pm. When the manager arrived, we were surprised to see how he was acting. I don't know whether this gentleman was under the influence of alcohol or what, but clearly he was not responsive with answers.

When we asked the manager, why in the menu it clearly says meat plater and the meat mentioned is clearly described in plural form as in sausages etc but in reality it was just 1 sausage. His response was this is the standard size whether you like it or not.

Then I ask do you really think this mixed grilled meat plater is enough for 3 people as your server described. His response was, ""I can give you more vegetable or salad to cover up the lose"".

So I immediately said to the manager, what you are doing is very bad. You gave the impression that we will get a load of meat but the portion of mixed grill plater worth Rs. 3200 is only enough for 1 person. It is unfair and unjust. We didn't want this incident to ruin our mood and destroy our night so we immediately requested for Bill, paid and left.

While we were leaving the server and security asked us to make a review so the owner apparently, Gihan Bandara would read this and take it seriously.

For love of God please avoid this place at all cost. There are better places next to this establishment which take care of the customers way better and at a reasonable cost. I have attached the receipt of the bill and picture of the plater.
I feel like we got scammed. I will never come to this place and I will make sure that my friends avoid Barracuda as well.",0
"I got a chance to spend that evening together with her.. Wow place.. anyone will be warmly welcomed by Baracuda but food wasn't up to my expected standard. Calm quiet sandy beach and whistling wind gave us life. Moreover they're really concerned about our safe side..for that they already have guards even to check whether there's trains coming on railway.to confirm safety when crossings.
No parking space available. You just have to park along the road.",1
"Service was very bad and we had to wait so long to order.
We have asked them to arrange a table for our anniversary celebration but it wasn‚Äôt arranged.
Too bad service.",0
"Well, I wanted to explore this place for some time. However, it prevented due to heavy traffic jam around due to construction of a bridge. Initially I thought of going to ‚ÄúThe Station‚Äù where I knew the place & visited several time. As I was SOLO ran out of partners, bit hesitant to go out.

First of all I wanted to find good place, watch LPL Cricket Match while having my dinner. As I have had Cricket practices in the afternoon, wanted to sip a beer. Alas ! No Corona. I mean the beer. However they had an offer during LPL. That is for 4 pints of Heineken for 1200/- nett., ordered that along with my vegetarian dinner. A steamed rice, 4 variety of mushroom chopsuey kind of dish. I felt five star. The bartender is also a nice guy.

Very decent place. Women group are also enjoying. But beware of Trains when you go back.",1
"3.5 stars.
Great location next to the beach. But it is not a high end place. The food and beer is good. The staff is courteous but service not exactly quick.
The entrance is quite odd. You need to cross railway tracks to get into the restaurant.
Overall, not a based place to spend the evening",0
Nice place to chill in the evening with frends and familly. Place is decorated with beautifull lighting and seating arrangement. Bar and band music are available. Mount lavinia beach is adjacent to this place with plesent scenery.,1
"This has been serving wonderful Thai, Chinese and grilled seafood for almost 4 years now.

The ambience is just what you need to relax your mind and enjoy a hearty meal. It‚Äôs a restaurant situated amidst screw pine trees.
The view that you see is that of the sea and  the sky changing with time, adding color to the experience. The chairs are set under the trees, under sheds and also on the coast.
Dinner is served under candle light and also fire torches lighting the sand.

The food is on point. The perfect dishes with probably the best chefs. Hot butter cuttlefish is one of their expertise. The sweet corn soup is lovely and fills your heart. The main dishes are mouthwatering and the best in Dehiwala.

The staff are very friendly and professional. They greet you with a smile and are always ready to make the stay comfortable.

Earlier they did not serve alcoholic beverages but the customers were allowed to bring in their own. Now they‚Äôve started serving alcohol. A mug of Carlsberg beer is priced at 275/- and so on.
They have Shisha as well the usual flavors, priced at 1600/-.

There‚Äôs ample amount of parking on the Marie drive guarded by the restaurant management.

It‚Äôs better to reserve a table over the phone before visiting it as it‚Äôs mostly packed.",1
Great food...but the staff is downright rude. On several occasions this had happened. Shows the lack of training...,0
Superb place to spend an evening. Beach side single restra. Ample amount of lights and sea wave sounds with deliciously good food. Prawns Fried Rice & Thai Red Curry we had along with local drink - Arrack,1
"The restaurant is situated in a beautiful and a calm place. The staff is very friendly and always available to support you. The food is great and personally I loved it. The liquor is served after 5 pm. The prices are little bit expensive but reasonable. Also, you can go for a walk in the beach as the restaurant is situated adjecent to the beach as well. So that is a bonus point. I recommend this place.",1
Foods is average. They got about one hour to serve fried rice. It also without chillie paste and sause. I dont whats the reason . Before 2years they had suprb service .,0
"Great experience! Excellent customer service and food, located right on the beach.",1
Good place to have a little chilling time. Food is expensive but small in  portion  and not much tasty. But good ambience.,0
View and the atmosphere was so good! Delicious foods & Prices are also reasonable! Great customer service! Friendly staff! Very helpful!,1
"Very good ambience. Great views of the ocean and has a clean beachfront to chill and take a stroll. They serve Alcohol except from 2p.m. to 5.p.m. They also have a happy hour from 5p.m. to 7p.m. so if you are going out to have few drinks and chill out, definitely recommend the place.

Food wise,they have a reasonably priced menu, the one we got was crispy calamari with chillie  sauce.The calamari was itself was good but the sauces were a let down as we got served with tomato ketchup ???? (Not spicy) and their special orange sauce. This one was a joke of sort as they used sunquick as their orange flavor. NOPE. They said they mixed sunquick with the other ingredients to mix the sauce but I honestly felt like they jist served us concentrated sunquick as a sauce. Other than that, it was very nice. Staff is friendly and acommodating. Wold visit again.",1
"Had 2 seafood platters, baked crab and hot butter cuttlefish, a steak and a few other dishes When food is not seasoned properly it's absolutely vile. All the vegetables that came with the food was spoiled. Broccoli zucchini and cauliflower and the mashed potato Probably days old. No stars is not an option here hence the one star. You can done in a five star hotel for the prices they charge. 25 k for rubbish.",0
"Most messed up place ive visited. Walked around for 15 minutes when I got there looking for a place to dine, the waiters dont care and when i finally asked a waiter for help he told me that i should go find the manager and ask him where we should sit? Where in the world does this happen? These guys have no idea what they're doing and look totally lost.. All you see is them running around. Took them 30 minutes just to get us beer mugs, we actually had to walk in the kitchen and get it since we got sick of waiting just on mugs. Seems like the staff got no idea on what they need to do. This place also has no covid precautions, just a tap near the gate. After all this me and my friends just wanted to leave. God knows what goes in their food. You get better service anywhere else guys.",0
"One of my all time favorites. However, during my last visit I felt that the quality of the food is little low than before. But still tasty.",0
Dishes are really good. I prefer Hot butter cuttlefish. Note that prices are higher. Cuttlefish large costed around 1200 LKR without other taxes (Extra taxes around 23%). Liquors are not available you have to bring it from outside.,1
Ambience is super cool for dinners and the food is really good and worth for the price but  the customer service is very very very poor !!! Hope they provide a good customer service  next time.we had to wait hours to get the menuüòè,0
This is a great place to have a drink and get some really amazing sea food. Ordered the buttered cuttlefish and curry leaf prawns. And also got Singaporean chill crab and prawn marinara. Really good place to eat as it's on the beach.,1
Really good place to have nice seafood meal. Seating available in the beach itself. Nice ambiance. Good service.,1
"Awesome place to have a drink, have very good food and hang around, you can take your own bottle from outside, no cokeage if you buy food.",1
A beach restaurant with a nice ambience. Cool and shady outdoor dining even during the day time regardless of it being right next to the beach which is mostly exposed to scorching sun. Good food especially sea food and good service.,1
"One of the best seafood restaurants by the beach BYOB food is quite good with lot of cusine choices.crowded usually. Try to reserve a table otherwise you will have to wait. Live music ,sand under your feet. Sea breeze with good food.",1
Great place. However the place can be too crowded at times and might have to stay longer than you expect to place an order,1
"Perfect service and fast food within 15 min after order. This is the only place I experienced in the Colombo suburb that much of speedy service to fulfill our order. Food was also tasty. The one who served us also good gentlemen and did his best to serve us.
Only matter was food prices. Only for 3 of us it cost around LKR 6,500 total with few common meals. Other than that everything was perfect.",1
"The service was above average, the
ambience was very good and the food was palatable.",0
"On behalf of all of us at Businessfocus360, we would like to thank the team at Barracuda Seafood and Grill for a fantastic and memorable evening held on the 10th of April 2021. I can assure you that everyone enjoyed the ambience at the function area and we were thrilled at the overall service given to us by your staff members. Moreover, the food was absolutely delectable and well worth for the price we paid.

We would also like to extend a big thank you out to the manager Mr. Beed, who truly went above and beyond to meet all our specific requirements. Mr. Beed was not only very accommodating but managed to exceed our expectations in terms of executing the function beautifully. Likewise, we would like to extend our appreciation out to Anjana; our waiter for the night as well as the in-house gardener who assisted us with the decorations and the post clean-up. Your efforts will never be forgotten by our team.

We wish team Barracuda nothing but the very best in their future endeavours and we hope to host many more events together with them soon.",1
Had wonderful time and the surrounding was awesome.  Food the Barracuda are really yummy.  But there BBQ was not a real-time one.  That is one concern and then they didn't allow to take excess food which we had paid already.  Other than that everything was fine. They arranged to get us a Karaoke even which was somewhat ok.,1
A knowledgeable service. Fresh and delicious food. Reasonably priced and got many varieties. Worth the wait as the view is great.,1
I am a frequent visitor to this place .Love the new hut on the beach. Menu wise my favourite is salt & pepper cuttlefis and pork belly üòã,1
"Nice place, delicious foods and awesome sea view. Five stars from me and recommend for anyone who thinking or planning for parties or get togethers or day outings.üëçüèª",1
"Nice atmosphere, beachfront property , outside dining. Tasty food and good service. Recommended place for a peaceful evening out.",1
"I had awesome dinner with my loved ones. I would really like to visit this place again. I can recommend this place to any body who like to enjoy Delicious food, Live music , Sea view with good customer service.",1
"nice and quite place..for anyone, families, friends, couples. environment is so nice. foods are good. all the things under a reasonable price.
the only thing is, Crows , because it's an almost open area. but no harm.",1
Great place to hang around have a drink and chill by the beach. Quality of foods is good but the portion size for the price is a bit less. Overall good experience.,1
"It was a pleasant evening with fresh sea food and live music.
Foods are tastefully freshly made and try to sizzler corner but get more on thai menu.
Prices are quite moderate but worth for the money.
PS: hot butter cuttlefish was extraordinary.",1
Little bit Expensive. But Nice Environment near the beach. Great Food and Drinks Selection üòã.,1
If you go for lunch expect disturbing flies since seated out near the beach.but great food and ambience.. professional staff !! I would give 4 stars for a dinner out when the flies are sleeping ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è,0
One of the popular spots on the beach to unwind and have a drink by the water. It‚Äôs a BYOB place and food is extremely reasonable and delicious üòã! Great for a romantic dinner with your loved one or for group of friends! Service could be little better but the fact they are always full explains the delay! Total chill spot worth trying out!,1
"Love the food here.Good variety. However, there are lot of flies around. Requested staff to move our food inside. Very helpful staff indeed.",1
"Nice and calm place. Good for friends, families and couples. Food was great. Superb customer service.",1
Nice place to enjoy. Foods are tasty and prices are worth.,1
The fastest food service in Colombo. Great place to drink at sunset. The food's not bad either,1
"Food was good, although not wow. Service was good and fast. My juice tasted of orange gone bad. :(",1
Very good quality food restaurant.  Very good location right on the beach. Very relaxing. The staff friendly. Bar and restaurant.,1
You can enjoy Live music and great food in this place. Recomend to reserve your table before you go,1
The food was good and worth the price. The drinks were not that good. Nice atmosphere.,1
Food tastes good. However the menu has not changed much over the years,1
"I enjoyed the atmosphere!!
Food is really good.
Hot butter cuttle fish tastes good!
Dishes are authentic.
Waiters are friendly but difficult to find them for re-orders as they were too busy due to crowd.
Demand to take beach side chairs.
Bit expensive for budget guys!",1
Super chilled out place for a dinner with boyb. Not the best seafood but amazing abiance.,0
Delicious food. The menu has a big variety of food. Friendly staff. Once I organized a dinner party for about 60 guests and the staff was helpful and gave me a really good service. The setting of the restaurant and the location is nice. Highly recommended.,1
tasty food! and welcoming staff! Seafood grilled platter must try and butter cuttlefish,1
"Chill place in evening time, foods are very delicious, and staff servents also friendly. üôÇ",1
"Nice place to hang out with family and friends. Beach outside sitting is available only after 6pm since its a public beach area. Inside sitting is well planned.
Food is good and priced well. Portion quantity was also good. Can bring your own bottles. Overall this is a good place to hang out.",1
"We ordered a small seafood fried rice and a spicy rice chicken for 4 people but one portion is more than enough because they give is huge portions. Crispy prawn balls were nice as a starter and hot butter calamari amazing, others were regular tastes.
We also ordered sex on the beach, Cinderella, virgin Mary and gummy bear. The taste of virgin Mary needs to improve and sex on beach and gummy bear was nice.
We were lucky enough to get a seat outside facing beach. But it's always better to put a reservation if possible before going.",1
Live music and good tasty food on the beach under the trees. Well set up and done nicely. Very energetic place with access to family and youngster,1
Trendy and decent place with great vibes. Staff is attentive and provides an efficient service. Food is absolutely delicious and prepared taking not too long. Customers are allowed to bring in their own booze without being charged for corkage. Prices are moderate.,1
"Great place next to sea. Great for dinner :)
Will enjoy with live dj & sea wind  but they serving too spicy üå∂ üò¢ better you take ice cream as desert :)",1
"Went for a dinner in February 2019 here. Experience was so good. Has a nice view of the beach. Can access the beach area. Had french fries, prawns and chicken for side dishes. Those were so fresh and tasty. Had sea food rice, noodles and chicken with gravy. Those too were good. Has a good service.",1
Nice cosy seaside restaurant and bar. Great seafood options to go with your drinks.,1
A great place to hangoutüñ§üî• Nice and friendly staff with good service.. a great environment for a lovely evening.,1
Food is really good. Even the service is really good. They are having customised options too. Staff is very friendly.,1
Great seafood with variety of choices. Clean and calm environment suitable for any age groups but gets crowded in the weekend so reserve a table beforehand. Beach view is beautiful and you can bring alcohol here they only serve meals and bites and sandy. Perfect place for a romantic dinner by the beach. Affordable prices and portions are pretty big too. I specially likes the malasiyan style sea food noodles and hot butter cuttlefish. Variety of Mocktails available.,1
"It is the best place for everyone to hangout with friends and family....
Service is superb...and there are no body to disturb our free time....",1
"Food is good, but little expensive.
In front of the beach & right beside the Colombo Galle rail track,  therefore make sure to be extra careful. Ortherwise it's ok",1
Baraccuda's service has become meh compared to last year. waiters just give excuses when we request for seating arrangements in distance even when there is no reserved tables neither no much crowd. Most importantly I didn't see they are sanitizing the tables after each use.  They just clean the stuff on the table to ground though a cloth and never see they practice hygiene while working around. I only see a handwashing and a thermometer near entrance with security who direct us to wash hands. but no QR code option... but on the other hand the food prices have gone up which is acceptable if they are practicing the health requirements and service well to maintain the cleanliness. I agree on cost of changes in some food items but not all affect. it was like  unfair when ordering for two. even though we need to order several items we cannot think of it due to the same high flat rate applied to all items. portions are well served for groups but not for two. one of my favorite place but feeling disappointed. not recommended especially during covid spreading environment like this. hope they will improve.,0
"Good location by the sea and dining tables arrange on the beach and under mangrove. Very good place for family dining or with friends. Good live music and perfect atmosphere for a relaxing drink and food. Restaurant doesn‚Äôt serve any alcohol drinks but you can take your own drinks with you. There is no corkage only for Beer and wine. If you are visiting the place you need to try hot butter cuttlefish which is one of their specialty
It's recommend that you booked a table prior to your visit because this restaurant is always crowded specially in weekends.",1
"I don‚Äôt liked at all, the most important things that the waters are not professional and rude and the food to serve to you table is to late.",0
No that great like those days! Had a very bad experience with the mixed grills recently! Quantity is also very poor for the cost!,0
Food is good and ambience is also good. Clenliness of the facility  specially  washrooms can be improved further.,1
"Highly recommended. Good place to hangout with friends and family.
Good music. Super friendly staff.
They have good cocktails and mocktails",1
The ambience is amazing and the food is good too. This is very nice to dine at nights. There are seats my beach side too.,1
Oh boy this is a bad place to be. They had good food and a stage service. Now it‚Äôs extremely bad service and average or eleven lesser food. Orders not take properly.  Late to serve. So the food is cold. It‚Äôs bad not recommended to anyone.,0
"Has the sea breeze and calm atmosphere for a dinner. Suitable for large groups of friends or families with kids. Has the basic food, appetisers and rangeb of drinks. Have to reserve tables before ahead to avoid any inconvenience cause the beach area is crowded at any day.",1
Food is good an average service. Since this is an outdoor restaurant they can't avoid the flies 100% but they can reduce by not collecting all the finished plates in one table and keeping them forever,0
"This is the one of best beach restaurant at dehiwala, mount Lavinia, it locates beautiful sea front garden and nice location, specially for birthday party‚Äôs , friends get togethers , they are providing good service and delicious food you can Oder many more seafood ü¶û and take tables by the beach and enjoy with evening, also you can bring your own alcohol and beverages. And Oder their delicious bites and food,",1
Very good place to have your dinner with your family and friends. Very taste and very hot food. You can bring alcohol and use it in the restaurant without any charge. Good sea food variety is available. Good mocktail manu is available. Price are reasonable. Very friendly service. View is very good (on the beach). Highly recommended.,1
A really nice place to hang out with your friends and colleagues.. ‚ù§Ô∏è Delicious üòã foods for mid range price.. Awesome live band show üòéüéâ  check this place üëç,1

"Very good place to hangout. Staff is very friendly. You have a great choices of meals and drinks you can get (Thai, Chinese, beverages, wine, cocktails, mocktails). Prices are reasonable.",1
One of my favourite place to have a dinner most of the time. Chilling with a beer and feel the sea wind is getting very relaxing feel for end of the day. Also foods are delicious and price is reasonable. Thank you for serving friendly customer care. Hope to visit very soon.,1
"Fantastic food and ambience. Must go for just the seafood and lamb chops. Enjoy the sea breeze while having a drink. In case they are not serving, you can pop in to the Keells nearby and they won't have an issue you having it there. Just perfect.",1
Good place next to the beach. Relaxing. Waiting staff was good and food was delicious.,1
Good place to go dinner outings. Nice place with a good view. Food also good. They have several menus to select. Can recommend.,1
"Nice place for good food on place, where local people used to have dinner, located on the edge of the sand beach. Very nice and helpful waiters. Ratio between price and value is good.",1
"Awesome place to have a chill. They dont have liquoir but beer cans can be brought in free. Liquoir bottles can also be bought in but a charge of 1500 rupees per bottle should be paid. Overall the prices are a bit high, but the background and vibes are just perfect for a tranquil night. The food is also scrumptious along with a variety of delicious drinks. I prefer the ""sex on the beach"" drink which was jist awesome. A jazz musician plays his trumpet to entertain guests and he does it really well.",1
Good place to enjoy but expensive.  Food are OK.,0
"Foods are not up to the standard, we requested fish fillet in Thai sauce but what they bought is Kind of deviled fish",0
Nice place have some drink. But little bit crowded.,0
Delicious food. Nice service. Recommended for dine out.,1
"perfect view,excellent customer service and very tasty food.highly recommend.",1
"Good place to have Beach side dinner
They have good mocktails and seafood platters",1
Loved the Hot butter cuttlefish. Highly recommended. No corkage if u buy the bites in-house. The price of 25ml tequila was around 315 per shot but on the bill it was charged 500 per short. Not sure how 10% services charge makes 315rs to 500rs üòí,1
Ordered a Cherry Cola mocktails and the spicy seafood rice. Food and drinks was good however service was poor. We had to wait nearly 30 minutes until a waiter noticed us and we could give our order. And even afterwards it took another 15 minutes to bring the drinks (2 beers included),0
"I have been here several times, and keep going back for more. Love the ambience the menu the staff and the service. Great place to hangout with friends, specially after work.",1
"Nice location, Tasty food but the problem was poor customer service. They have not enough staff to serve to customers.",1
"Dined yesterday (28th), as usual the food was scrumptious. Good service. Great entertainment too. Loved the band.",1
Great place to enjoy the evening with beach restaurant.,1
"Worst at everything
Customer service is so low they took one hour to bring a water bottle and the seafood rice was a junk and do double check the bill before paying, they add extra meals for the bill without even serving !",0
Ita always the best veiw and great tasting meals love the layouts and people who serve you with pleasure,1
Good restaurant near beach... best for night... tasty food...  high price but it's some worth.... high class look and friendly service.... I'm happy about that place üòäüòä,1
Good place to hang out. My favourite place. Good food.,1
Excellent food and service. Choose the table on the beach ( sandy area ) and not inside. It's more relaxing outside with the breeze.,1
The music was very nice and the waiter Roshan was very friendly and good,1
"The food was amazing. We ordered Nasi Goreng it was a big portion but the taste was fantastic and we also ordered Chicken Alfredo Pasta which was very creamy and delicious.
Alcohol is slightly higher priced but over all a great and memorable experience.
Waiters were really humble and professional service was given.
Best to go as a group of friends or for a nice romantic date nightüòÅ",1
One of the best places for sea food lovers. Super tasty foods to enjoy.,1

Great place to have fresh seafood by the beach. A bit pricey though.,1
One of the best place to hangout with friends and family... great food great music and great sea breeze... if you can go by around 4pm 4.30pm you will experience great view of sunset... better if you can prebook and go there... can take liquor from outside and if Bill goes greater than 12k the corkage free if not corkage will be around 1000 to 1500...

Great food and great place to hangout except for the fact of crossing the railway,1
"The food was great and well worth the price. The place borders the beach. Ambience is pretty good too, if you don't mind the sound of the occasional train.",1
Good place to hangout with your friends. Better reserve the table first after giving a call to them. The ideal time is the eveing. The beach is quite dirty at the other side. Service is good. The food is lil bit pricy. Reccomanded.,1
"Ordered a small potion of batter fried cuttlefish and a mixed grill. Cuttlefish fish was good but the mixed grill was really bad...

Half of the meat was gizzard and chicken liver which seemed cheap and the vegetables tasted old.

Kept quiet about the meat but told our waiter about the vegetables and to pass the message to the chef but got no feedback or any kind of response from the chef.

You guys should have a much better mixed grill or at least better customer service...",0
"Great location by the beach. Spacious and nice ambiance. Friendly and good staff. Alcohol is not very expensive. A huge menu with a broad variety of food. A reservation is recommended if you need a good table in the beach.
Recently me and my partner had the Barracuda Mixed Grill (meat) and the experience wasn‚Äôt very pleasant. There were many chicken parts (hearts & liver) and did not taste good. Beef and the lamb tasted old and chewy.",0
Great ambiance & delicious food. Also you can bring in your own liquor. Beach side seating available,1
"Good food. Good customer care. Good speed of food preparation.
Has bar.",1
Nice place to hangout with friends or family. Sea food items are their specialty. Make sure it doesn't rain when you visit this place so you can reserve a beach table.,1
One of the best seafood restaurants in colombo area. Tasty food,1
Very nice restaurant and I think it is one of the best in Colombo,1
Superb place to Enjoy and chill with friends,1
Attended a birthday party here.... Service was good... compared to the previous experience. I must say the band that was there ( 3 piece) was very good.... I highly recommend them for a family function....,0

Superb place for day outings with families or friends.,1
"Food is great. Drinks are a bit overpriced and currently have an added surcharge. Ambience is good, however people started to dance to the band despite a signpost prohibiting it!",1
Good place and a calm place. Music is also good. Nice thing to feel the sea breeze while being in the place. Food was relatively fine.,1
Nice food & the music also. love to go again,1
Quality local pub food and excellent attentive service! It's byo as they have no liquor licence and the place is kept very clean and tidy.,1

Foods are tasty and small posion enough for three peoples .",1
Good food -- beach environment - need to bring liquor out side,1
The most amazing service by Saranga Amazing food,1
What a location! Arrived on a Friday evening to find the place pleasantly full but not packed. The house band was very good and the service impeccable. Didn't have a main dish but the starters were perfectly prepared. The ambiance is great at this place as they have made a choice to keep as many trees as possible. It really adds character to this place.I Beware that the entrance is over to train tracks so keep your head on a swivel crossing. Great place to spend an evening.,1
"A good place to spend your evening with your buddies over a bottle of beer.

Entrance to the place is bit sketchy as you need to cross the rail tracks. How ever the place is popular even for a Monday night it was quite packed.

Wait staff is courteous friendly and fast that will keep you and your friends happy. Service I would say quite fast as during our visit the place was literally packed to the brim.

Food was ok nothing special to brag about.",1
Good food. But to our surprise one of the staff members asked for our Johnnie Walker Black bottle which had about 1/4 left over drinks. We politely gave it to that person. It's a funny incident. But if this is something that they do as a habit somebody should take an action I believe.,0
"Was helped in by Beed. Enjoyed our interactions and I highly recommend this restaurant. The ambiance is 100. From live band, lighting, breeze from the ocean. This place is great to visit. Can also get hookah and beer tower. Can't go wrong visiting this place!",1
"Menu has lot of options.
Has a variety of drinks as well. You can get a nice meal with a elegant view. There's a AC seating inside, but who wants it when you can watch the sea and sit under a tree.
Really friendly staff. An elegant place. Not much expensive as well.",1
"Good food, good venue.  You can enjoy a beautiful sunset sipping a mojito and tasting delicious seafood.  Staff is attentive but a little overwhelmed at times. If you are going on a weekend, call in advance and reserve. Highly recommend.",1
"Visited barracuda on Friday (19th June 2020) there was a quite a crowd. Also, said most of the tables were booked or occupied. After giving a table we had to wait for almost 20 mins for a steward to come with a menu. And even to order more we have to keep asking someone to come for some time. Other than that the food was good. Entertainment is good. Sorry, I don't have any pictures to post.

Enjoy.",0
"Great location next to the beach. You can even reserve the tables in advance for the beach side serving. Food is ok and not that great. Hot prawns were disappointing, they came cold . Fish was ok. Juices were good. Music was also disappointing, they don't have a proper collection.",0
They took more than 1 hour to serve a single meal üòí,0
Nice ambience. Staff is nice. Food is tasty especially the seafood.,1
Nice and kindfull place for food and drinks,1
"Good place to spend time with your loved ones, prices are responsible, foods also tasty.",1
"Moderately priced. Decent food. By the beach. Bring your own alcohol. Some foods are better than others, I found their grill menu to be lacking. And the toilet was s**t. Also they don't get some foods right all the time. Your hot butter cuttlefish depends on your karma. Basically great place to chill with friends to have a drink and not spend a bomb.",0
"Wow, we totally enjoyed our meal.
The sandwiches look good and tasted even better. My vegetarian spring rolls were yummy and the lobster was Fantastic. Not too impressed with the chicken spring rolls though but no issues at all they just knocked it off the bill.
Top place to visit and a nice experience.
Top marks from Hilton Travel.",1
Nice cozy restaurant beachside. Sea food was great and same is the service. This place doesn't serve liquor however one can carry and they don't charge corkage. Famous place among tourists and dinner is served until 11pm. Good place for all types of groups including families.,1
"Great stuff , but slow service and high service charges",1
"Relaxation place, tasty foods for reasonable price.",1
"It's quite a nice place. It's good that they have people to make sure guests cross the railroad safely.
It's pretty clean and safe.
However, the quality of food has deteriorated since the last time I was there. It was too salty and some of the dishes were tasteless. Service was good though.",0
"Great location on the beach and super beach decor and ambience once you get over walking over a railway track to get there which is very different and a bit exciting. We were in a group of 4 and the waiters took orders for meals very quickly, they were very friendly, attentive and most of all efficient. It was very good because the kitchen knew we were family of four and knew how much food to put in to each dish even though we ordered a medium they knew I was there so they put a bit extra in. We barely had to wait for our food to arrive at our table, the wait was about 15 minuets. My favourite dish was the battered cuttlefish, you cant get it that good any where else in the world. No fault with the food or the service. The food tasted like it had just been imported from heaven however food from heaven is expensive is costs about 8,000Rs (local currency) $80 in Australia. The reason that it was expensive in Sri Lankan rupees was because we also had a sea bath before hand so we had worked up an appetite, especially me. Maybe if you went when it was busy you would have had a much different experience but we went at the right time on the right day because the atmosphere was good and the sunset was beautiful. I would definitely recommend going there. I rate it five out of five but if you do decide to go there try keep a limit of 10 people because the food could take longer to prepare.",1
Beach and Good food. Good place for the children also,1
Delicious foodsüç±üçª & reasonable price. Be aware about the trains while you crossing the railwayüöÇüöÇ,1
Prices were really reasonable for the portions we got and the ambience was really relaxing.,1
"Nice place to take your family for dinner. Great food and the atmosphere. Waiters are friendly and the service is very efficient.

Food quality is very good. The prices are quite high but fully worth it.

Need to cross the railway track to get to the restaurent. At night it can be dangerous. No allocated parking. However you can park alongside the adjacent road.",1
"A nice place facing to the beach. Well spacious. There is no parking facility dedicated to this restaurant instead you can park on the Marine drive across the railway road.

The menu has a quite big variety of food. The food is tasty. However on busy days it takes a lot of time to deliver orders to the table. You may need to remind the waiter again and again.

Liquor is allowed in the place and sometimes you can experience live music as well. A good place for small groups and families.

You have to cross the rail road when accessing this restaurant so be very careful while crossing the railroad. There is a signal cabin so you cannot see the distance very well. Keep in mind there can be another train on the other line though a train passes you.",1
Vary bad attitude and the behavior of Tamil waiter in there,0
Good place to hang in with friends. Foods are good. And the surrounding also nice.,1
"We‚Äôll recommend for any one.Tasty foods ,Nice place to hang out with friends",1
"If you want to have some nice finger food over a beer or a decent meal while you dip your toes in the sand, Barracuda will get you there. Even though they don‚Äôt serve alcohol as it is a family friendly restaurant, they allow you to BYOB as long as you order food from them. The staff is extremely helpful and goes out of their way to provide a good customer service. Hot butter cuttlefish is one of the best in town. If you want to get a table of the open area on the sand, a reservation is advised specially on weekends as it gets busy. Live music is on, on weekends and is the perfect place to chill.",1
A beach side restaurent and you can entertain BYOB with reasonable corkage. They have selective signature dishes which you will become familiar to upon frequent visits. Stewards are good in hospitality and communications. Only draw back side which i would like to suggest in view of fine tuning their quality is the noise level of the speakers and songs. Try their hot battered mushrooms and hot battered cuttle fish. Simply superb,1
OMG the food was amazing. such a nice place.,1
"Amazing venue and great service. I would recommend for casual dates, family dinners and office outings. They do not provide alcohol however, you can bring your own booze as long as you spend around 2-3K rs,  per head. Again highly recommended.",1
"Food, service and music was great!",1
Great place near the sea. Cozy atmosphere with good calming music. Food is also very good and there's wide variety of dishes. No better place to sit down and enjoy some good quality food while enjoying the beautiful scenery of sun setting behind the ocean.,1
Visit in the he evening to view sun set with a cool üçª or hard glass.. when crowded took much time to serve and closing by 9.30 pm due to health guidelines these days..,0
"Ordered crab for lunch and was very disappointed by the quality of the crab. Crab sauce was fine but crab was not fresh at all.  Crab meat was way too soft and mushy.  I also ordered a drink that never came and they still tried to charge me for it on the first bill and tried to say it was coming when I was leaving.  Luckily, they took it off the bill, in the end.  The only thing going for this place is that it‚Äôs close to the beach but flies will swarm your food immediately.  All in all, very disappointed.",0
Very tasty and colorful food. Many choices. Nice staff üòä,1
"Went in with a local friend, was immediately told no tables available, however there were plenty of tables available. Absolutely pathetic, they judge based on appearance and cater for only white foreigners. Decided to go to the station instead, best decision ever, service was absolutely top notch with amazibg food and drinks. Am going to reccommend the station for sure to everyone, as for the barracuda - good luck as you will never get my business nor any of my contacts after the discriminating act you showed. If you really want good food and service, please go to the station next door to this restaurant, they are much better at all levels.!!",0
A concept that hasn't changed much in the last decade because it doesn't need to. A place to come with family or friends and have a nice family style (Sri Lankan-Chinese) meal with shared food platters and bites. BYOB with no corkage so long as your food bill is reasonable. Sit inside the wooden rafters or out on the beach. Live music on the weekends,1
"We actually enjoyed the restaurant. The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was cozy. The only issue was the the restaurant is right next to the train tracks, which can cause the trains to literally shake the seats and tables. And the train horn can be quite loud. The kids got scared at first. Also in order to go into and out of the restaurant you have to cross the train tracks.
Please LIKE the review if you found it helpful üëç",1
Excellent location. Tasty foods. Friendly staff,1
Pls buy a new cutlery to Dehiwala Barracuda. I visit twice a month to ur place and sad to see the old discoloured cutlery.,0
"Barracuda has come along way since it's humble and somewhat unique days. While cleverly retaining it's rustic charm, the menu and service has seen an upgrade, with Italian and other international menus on its list, the customer is spoilt for choice. Barracuda gets a good portion of the city's working crowd patronizing the place, not surprising considering the jungle like beach setting with outdoor, indoor and on-the-beach dining, a well sought-after break from routine. Even with the high capacity attendance, the waiters provide excellent service, all the while being courteous and friendly. Barracuda is highly recommended for anyone wanting to have a memorable evening with a reasonable price tag.",1
"Lot of varieties of sea food dishes.  Beach side environment.. out door sitting. Friendly welcoming. There are lot of positive things. Of course crowded place. But the good place for the entertainment. Cost is ultimately high. To have a get together with friends, this is one of the best place in Colombo",1
"It has been a good place a few years back. Nowadays the service is not up to the standards. Lack of enough staff may have caused that. Staff are not well trained and to learn a lot. I suggest The Station would be better choice if you love to hangout at the beach front. They do not have a bar, but you can bring your own bottles.",1
"Nice ambience. Staff needs training for sure, not about being polite but about being attentive and ensuring quick service. Overall, a laid back place for your evenings. No cocktails or liquor here, don't let the hoarding outside deceive you! 50% of tables, i.e. 100% of beach side and good view tables are tagged reserved and stay empty during you entire meal. Be aware of the deals as posted outside the place, as staff isn't very happy to offer these unless you ask and point to it. Shisha price is mentioned as 1100 on the board outside, but if you overlook, you would be charged 1600.

Coming to food, quantity makes you happy, taste  seems not wrong at all, and wallet friendly too.

Enjoy with caution!!",1
Nice place. Had a few gatherings with friends. Good & tasty food. You can BYOB. If u plan to go there u should try their Hot Butter Cuttlefish dish. Its superb.,1
"It's a place by the sea. Beautiful at evenings with light lit up. Nice place to have a chill out with friends n family. You've got to get your own booze. Friendly staff.

Should be Extra careful when you get here coz it's close to the railway track. Should always be vigilant.

I'm not a fan of their food and do not recommend this place for wedding functions.",0
"A place on the beach in Colombo which is a bit hard to find. Confused as there is more natural beach than I knew. May be because of the Colombo sea fill project.

Good food, drink and service was great with a live band playing.

Guess a nice alternative chill out place to hikkaduwa. üòÅ",1
Food was spoiled and tasteless.. we ordered fresh orenge juice but  we were given sunquick with an orenge wedge.. not satisfy at all and definitely will not recommend,0
"Very good food, very attentive staff, has diverse menus to choose from. Seating can be chosen from 4 areas Beach, Inner courtyard adjoining the beach, air conditioned area or party area.
Beverages are permitted to be brought if main meals or bites are ordered.
Prior reservations advisable.",1
The quality of food has gone down...the prices r very high & the portions definitely should increase the quantity specially hot butter cuttlefish for the amount they charge,0
"Nice quite place to have meal. Music is played all around the restaurant. Waiter is very friendly and provided better service. I had an excellent mocktail (Frozen something! Don't actually remember the name ;p). Green salad and Creamy Mushroom Soup also better. But the mangolien seafood rice was not upto my expectation. It was tasty but the seafood is not upto the standard. Very very tiny shrimps and little pieces of cutlefish. Since i am from east coast i know how i used to have seafood meals there. Maybe it's difficult to get the quality materials. Wherever I go almost all the restaurant has the seafood quality issue in the west. ;)
Otherwise all the meals are perfect.",1
Beautiful place and good place to have dinner!,1
"Good place to go hangout with friend since they have BYOB option. Food is abit on the expensive side. Tastes good. However, you have to wrap up close to 12 itself. So no very late nights. Once a waiter requested for a small shot when we were leaving. Abit unprofessional on that part",0
Prices are bit high but good overall vibe.,1
"A bit expensive for me, but high quality food",0
A great place for an evening meal with friends and family. Sea view is perfect for a way to end the day. The ambiance and the food is good. And the staff are so firdndly.,1
Good food but they need to speed up the service.,0
"Pretty mass market. Not very fresh or inspiring food options. Quality of food was not great especially for the price. Nice setting on the beach and outdoor setting. Loud, overbearing musicians meant we couldn‚Äôt really have a decent conversation.",0
Wow finger liking taste with lovely service.,1
"Restaurant by the beach, only negative is u have to cross the railway tracks, so it's a no no for oldies with trouble walking. Ordered a platter which was served as a sizzler which was quite disappointing, so was the serving portion. But the Thai fish curry served with rice was very tasty. Overall very expensive place to eat, not much value for money.",1
A good place to go on team outing I am recommending this place,1
"Just the place to take your partner for a dinner. Make sure to book a table in the beach early. Food is great but costly. This is one of the best places in Colombo which I find really romantic. Sea view & breeze at the night is mind blowing and relaxing. Parking is not available sometimes & no liquor is served, however outside liquor is allowed. So that's there. Despite that this is such a great place to spend a relaxing & romantic evening.",1
Nice place for a small party or a dinner out. Very very good seafood options are there. Nice view of the beach as well. Some times parking will be difficult because there is no dedicated parkinf. But can managable. Friendly and helpful staff and minimal waiting time. Good if they can improve the washrooms because the place is always filled with guests.,1
"One of the worst experiences I've ever had while dining in, never will I return back to the place again neither do recommend it to anyone. No proper customer service and even the duty manager Mr Thisara  is a very ride person, he doesn't even know to talk to a customer properly. I'm disgusted by his unprofessionalsm.",0
"Service is not prompt, food are ok.",0
"Nice place to enjoy. Can have our own arrangements with them. Area along with beach is really interested. Foods are very tasteful and have enough varieties to experience.

Safely is a important factor when crossing the railway.",1
"We came to the barracuda restaurant and its a very nice place ans everything. we booked a time but we didnt get a good place to sit at. when we came there was very good service and we ordered food. when we started to get the food there was a employee whos name is shadeep who gave us our preordered food but then started to give us random food saying (lying) that it was ours. we said that it wasnt ours and he came at us that he was gonna pick a fight. he has very bad behavior and i would like for someone to speak with him.
ive been to alot of hotels and restaurants and this has been one of my worst experiences and i wasn‚Äôt expecting this i hope that this complaint has given u the right for u to change the behavior of the young man. thanks",0
Only been here in the evening and by that time the place is pretty busy always. Good food and good atmosphere. Outside seating on the beach is really nice. ordering food from the servers can take longer than usual when the place  is busy so better to order everything at once.,1
Great food and quick service.,1
"We went there yesterday night. Me and husband. The guy who was our waiter was Shanuka. Very nice and helpful guy. We wanted a table at the beach and he arranged us one. Shanuka is a young waiter. He said he was from Polonnaruwa. Apart from the service he gave us, the food was also very tasty. I wish all the best to Shanuka. Thanks so much for your pleasing service. üëèüëè",1
"It is a very cozy place witha great sea view near by Dehiwala. A calm place which surrounded by beach and sea wind.
Their menu is very tasty and has variety of food including sea food and foods of different cultures.
They allow to bring liqur from outside. So it is a good place for team outings and also for family outings.
The place and the Wash rooms are clean. Price is also reasonable according to their service and facilities.",1
"You have a large renge of food selection as you wish. Great taste and helpfull staff. you can enjoy your food inside or outside sandy area in beach. We went on a Sunday and we met this man displaying his talents with fire. Many couples were there and some groups. All the things were good, but no separated car park for this bech restaurant. You have to park your vehicle somewhere in the road.",1
Best place to have a child beer with sea breeze... Affordable...,1
Good place for meetups. Recommended,1
Be aware of the rail crossing. Not safe. Especially when taking little children. Its a family restaurant.Convenient location. Sufficient parking by the side of the road. Private staff ti help you park and it involves a  tip. Their food is amazing. Sizzlers to highlight.,1
"First off, they don't serve alcohol. You have to bring your own booze. The place is large and has outside seating near the sea. Only downside for the group of 12 that visited the other day was that there was an odd smell coming from the sea area.

The orders took a long time to come. But, I must admit that their Hot Butter Cuttlefish was awesome. We also had the Prawn balls which were nice too. Their mocktail Ambrosio was delicious. For mains we had the Spicy chicken fried rice with Chicken Schezwan and Prawn in Garlic Sauce.

Overall the food was good. They need to improve their service timings as there was no coordination or segregation for the waiters to follow, they were all over the place.",1
So beautiful places and Good foods.,1
Always put a reservation before going there as it can be full of people. However luckily we found a seating near to the beach. Hot buttered cuttlefish is a must try. Portions are large. Worth the money. Car parking along side the road.. music was loud that day which sort of ruined the atmosphere.,1
"The food was amazing and the place was very pleasant in its appearance. There was a live band that my family and I enjoyed. However, at the far end of the restaurant, there was a different music being played which disturbed the live music.",1
"Went there for the second time and experience was much better this time, good view to the beach and foods are OK too, but little bit oily. Their soup is very good and it's mixed with eggs. Sadly I don't remember the name of it.
They don't have a proper parking area and I had to face many difficulties to park my car on a Friday night.",1
"Portions have gotten smaller and more expensive. Still byo with minimal to no corkage as long as you order mains. Bathrooms are kept relatively clean. Sometimes you will get very good staff whom are attentive and will check if you need anything more and sometimes you will get someone who comes only to take your order and deliver it and you'll never see them again till its time to pay the bill and they expect to be tipped. We had to place secondary orders through a second waiter. Used to be a cod competitor to The Station but now both have become equally ""meh"" with food portion size and service.",0
"This place is situated in a nice area overlooking the beach,has indoor and outdoor seating. No liquor is sold here but you can take from outside but the corkage prize is way too much. Staff is really unfriendly and service takes for ever,best to order food when you sit down. You can't get extra chairs to a table and they ask you to leave if they cant arrange seating.",0
"The venue has a lovely ambiance, especially as the sunsets. There's a decent crowd that costs the place. The food is better than what's offered at the station and servings are very generous. Particularly noodle and rice portions.",1
It's a good restaurant and beer bar but families with the small childrens are also entering which should be not allowed.,1
This is really good place for people looking a beach side restaurant. Foods are delicious. You can have liquor also. Their service is good. You can select  indoor or outdoor Tables otherwise beach area table. Light music also available.,0
"Not much of a fan of the place. Ok place to hang out with some friends. Located along the Mount-dehiwala coast line you can face the ocean while having a meal. Go here for dinner. Lunch time can be really hot under the sun.

Food is OK. The hot butter cuttlefish is recommended although the portion size is a bit small. The drinks are alright.

Unless you are seated on one of the tables on the beach you won't enjoy the experience fully.",0
"Food was delicious, but the service to the tables was really slow... Please give some more attention to your visitors.",1
"The place to go with friends or family when you are around Dehiwala beach. Food is delicious, price is reasonable and the potion size ample. Service is good, especially compared to the adjoining establishment.",1
Nice place to hangout with your friends and family. Go there in the evening. You can see the beautiful sunset. Most of the tables are on the beach. No liquor avaiable. But you can bring your own and they charge corkage. Food is also good.,1
"We went on friday and the Service was so delayed. It was so hot in the inside and we asked for a fan. They have limited table fans . They could have  fixed few ceiling fans. Asked 3 times for a glass even the manager/supervisor was so lazy to get it quickly. Supervisors  are having attitude problems it seems!. We saw only the Stewarts are rhe hard working.
Food was not tasty. Only music band was very good.",0
The staff are very friendly & the food is amazing! Try the dual flavoured Garupa! Definitely one of the best dishes they have! & of course their hot butter cuttle fish is pretty as well! The floor manager Thushara specially is super nice!,1
Good place ...delight foods,1
A nice place to chill with friends and family. This is a BYOB place and the food is nice and reasonable portions. But it takes forever to get the attention of someone to order your food. They have pretty good cocktails and mocktails.,1
This is awesome place! Highly recommended for all. Can bring liquor but not beer. Beer and liquor are double expensive ü§£. Anyway this is good place,1
"This place is one of the famous restaurants in Colombo. You can either stay inside or stay at the beach. Theres live music as well, on fridays and weekends as i know. Food is okay nothing to complain. Prices are reasonable as well. Be safe on crossing the railway. Try out the sizzle.",1
Great place to have a drink or dinner with your loved ones. Their food plates are a bit large when compared to others. And they are very tasty too. Should try the Hot Butter Cuttlefish & Deep fried Chicken with pepper & salt.,1
"Good food. Good place to have lunch, dinner or drink with family or friends. They have live DJ music. Next to the beach. If you want to sit on beach tables better to make a reservation first as everyone wants to sit there.",1
"Tasty food, nice view. Will come again 100%",1
A good place for hangouts. They have shisha for 1200rs,1
Nice place to relax and have good food with family and friends. Very good customer service and still very lively in the mid of this covid situation while adhering to safety regulations .,1
Amazing experience. Tasty Foods,1
"In Sri Lanka terms this is a budget sea front restaurant if u want to take your own booze. The place has a fairly decent beach front.  The ambience is good and also quite private.

Food is average at best and it's best to keep it at finger foods.

You have to be careful when you get to this place, as you have to go across the railway line.  The place got to much publicity when two teenagers who were careless crossed the railway and were run over by a train.  Since then the venue management has added more security who will blow the whistle and watch over as you cross the railway.",1
Superb sea food restaurant. Crab green curry is yummy and recommend. Chinese and Thai food served . No bar. But you can take your own liquor. Yummy food . Friendly staff. Take long time to arrange the order . Little bit crowded.,1
"This is by far one of my favorite places to eat in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Right off the beach, live music, and the food is amazing. I make it a point to visit here every time I come to Sri Lanka for a visit. The service is great and very friendly! Just LOVE it!!!",1
Calm and quiet place to have a lunch.. good customer service,0
Interesting place considering that I am from the States... Had to walk over some train tracks to get to the front door.. but once inside... wow... what a cool place! We actually ate on the beach.. and you walk under a canopy of trees to get to the tables. I really enjoyed it.... Oh and the butter mushroom appetizer was awesome  ! Check it out !,1
This place is amazing. I had an amazing time here. this place has a great ocean view. customers can enjoy freely here.,1
"Very chilled out place for alfresco dining under the cover of trees and fairy lights. There is a Chinese menu and sizzler grill menu. We tried the Chinese menu and the portions are big, fresh and delicious. I have eaten a lot of Chinese food and this is up there with some of the Malaysian Chinese food I have eaten (never been to China or Hong Kong) Ideal couples place in the evening but also had families there as well. There is a no singing and dancing policy which we found hard to keep to as there was live sax music playing popular tunes at the time. Friendly and attentive waiters.",1
Awesome food. Very nicely presented and tasty as well. One of the best Phad Thai Goong and Red Curry I've ever had. Clean and very nice atmosphere. :) Will always love to go there for Thai or Chinese. Keep it up :),1
Nice place.. slow service ... Good food :-),1
Very good seafood grill. Highly recommended,1
"Service was very poor.  They didn't even provide paper tissues and water to the tables.  Music was monotonous.  Despite the beach and sea wind it was smelling bad. Despite the efforts of the Buddhist government to stop alcohol usage on poya day they were serving alcohol without any restrictions.  It started raining and we at the beach table getting wet.  Hotel doesn't have any measures to mitigate.  The only good thing about the hotel was they have lots of varieties including Chinese,  Japanese and thai food.",0
"Good place to enjoy an evening with friends, good food amazing beach and friendly service. They offer large portions of food at a reasonable price. Highly recommended.",1
"Food here is good and reasonably priced... If you are going there to drink you can take alcohol from outside and if your bill is more than 14,000 they won't charge corkage... Service is also good and better reserve as it can be busy at nights but during day it's not that busy...",1
"One of the super place located in Dehiwala. Nice place to have a chill out with friends and family. It has a nice view of the beach as well. There is no dedicated parking space here.
Good place for sea food.",1
"Great environment by the ocean. Food is very good. The only reason I am giving one less star is the fact you have to cross the rail tracks to enter the hotel, I found that quite interesting.",1
A chilled place right at a very convenient location. Been there a multiple times. Beach front. Good place to chill with a ice cold glass of beer...,1
This place is ideal to have an evening meal with your friends. They also offer corkage free of charge for liquor bottles. so you can take any number of bottles freely. Still you have to buy bites from them.,1
Had the chicken fried rice and some fish and a dry dish. Good location easy drive down the marine drive from Colombo. Food quality was good. A nice break out of  but still in Colombo. Near location for a quick beach side outing and lunch for kids.,1
"Good place if you are looking for a beach restaurant with beach hut atmosphere in Colombo. I've seen people celebrating b'days, proposals, anniversaries etc. It serves liquor, so sometimes it can be a bit crowded and loud.",1
Wanted a relaxing evening but it spoilt by the staff. We ordered Lasagna for kids but it was cold. When we complained their reaction were rude and aggressive. Didn‚Äôt apologise for their fault or we could not meet the manager. Not suitable for family or kids because they don‚Äôt know how to respect their customers.,0
Atmosphere was great but food and cocktails were below average. Don't waste your money on the sweet n sour lobster.,0
"Nice BYOB place. Food is really nice but takes ages to get the attention of a staff members to order something.
Would recommend the tables on the beach. Better do a reservation prior, in order to get a decent table.",0
"Great place to meet with friends and family (suitable for children - they are quite entertained by the beach!). Go a bit early and enjoy a fabulous Colombo sunset over the ocean. Service for tables on the beach is available only after 6. Its a lovely stretch of as yet unspoiled beach. Try their hot butter cuttlefish! Also love their thai green veg curry, indonesian chicken curry and sizzlers.",1
"I have been to this place several times and would like to highlight the positives & Negatives.

Positives
01. Great location and Ambiance
02. Quick Service

Negatives
01. Food quality is disappointing when comparing to the price
02. Food portions are very low comparing to nearby similar beach restaurants
03. There is 10% service charge and 12% Vat to your bill
04. Unprofessional Staff behavior.",0
"Just had the worst meat platter we've ever had. It was 70% vegetables and meat was mostly chicken liver and gizzards which was ridiculous. Vegetables tasted like they were cooked in sewer water and meat was hard and tasted like rubber. French fries were like rubber, hard and chewy. We couldnt eat it and just left the place feeling sick in our stomachs. Overall it tasted disgusting.",0
Friendly staff and Food is delicious üòã,1
This place have awesome foods and shisha. This place have best coustomer service. Highly recommended for beach chill out.,1
"They serve kan kung with grass in it , no apologise even though we showed it to manager... i rest my case there......",0
Good food. Good service,1
"Wow what to say... Portions lets start there, the small vermicelli chicken (Thai menu) was huge. It could easily feed 3ppl even for American portions. It was cooked how you'd expect and we kept digging in. I had the Chicken Green Curry (Thai menu) the spice was perfect it was not off the charts which is good for people who like spicy food but don't want to burn their insides. It was flavorful and smooth. I'd recommend getting a side of steamed rice to consume with it. The third dish we had was the Deep Fried Sea Food my friend says its unsettling and I tried a little bit, I agree stay away from that dish. It's soggy because the amount of orange sauce and the fried part was basically gone do to being over saturated.

I still recommend this place as a four star location as the menu is huge and has alot of options. I can't justify 5 stars due to the one bad dish and if this place were busy I'm assuming the service would be much slower.
At any rate its still worth your time.",1
Pretty chilled out atmosphere. Great food. Has several 'mini' locations that can accommodate the public as well as small private functions at the same time. They have both indoor and outdoor areas available. This place is right on the beach.,1
Place is super nice. But day by day their service is getting worse. Has to wait for a long time to order and even to get cutlery sometimes. Food is yummy. Because of the very poor service standards I don't wanna go there again,0
Amazing food and atmosphere. Specially the hot butter cuttle fish. Is the best I had. The black pepper also good but too much oil pieces instead of meat.,1
Nice and ambiance to chille out..,0
"Exceptionally poor quality seafood.  Prices are on par with mixed grill restaurants around the world; portion sizes are very small, consisting mainly of rice and fried cabbage.

Had I been on familiar turf I would have refused to pay for the meal.  When I expressed my dissatisfaction to the maitre d' I was told the poor quality was my waiters fault(absurd).

This is not a restaurant for those who appreciate good food.  Avoid at all costs.",0
"The hidden place along the gake road towards Dehiwala is quite ideal for friends and family who fancy a good meal facing the sea. The breeze is so romantic that even couples could dine decently and then enjoy a little bit of the beach.

Although you have to use the beach at your own risk, I'd recommend it very much. The restaurant among the trees is also nice. The service is nicer. I found Chinese, Thai and seafood menus where I chose a vegetarian meal. The food was good. The vegetable salad was out of this world.

Many foreigners who love a shisha and a chat along with a nicemeal cones here. Parking is done along the main road yet is safe. Be careful when crossing the railway with kids if you're taking any.",1
"We held a function on Sunday 17/3/2019 for 35 people.  Dinesh and Janeesha were very accommodating even offering to help a few guests over the train tracks due to walkers and mobility issues. So dont let the train tracks stop you from going to this amazing beautiful place.

We were initially hesitant to order the hot buttered cuttlefish as part of our set menu - although both Janeesha and Dinesh urged us to try it as it is their signature dish.  Well ...... we were not disappointed. It truely is the best dish. The buffet and desserts were perfect. The view and wait staff awesome.

Thank you so much for making the celebration a wonderful experience.  Definitely consider Barracuda for a memorable experience of Sri Lanka.

Beautiful place but sorry to say service is really poor... Food is ok.. give some training to staff so they will make customers happy..,0
"Quick service and yummy hot butter cuttlefish!
The staff was friendly and it's open 11 am to 11 pm, so coming in at an odd hour in between is no problem. Walked in craving a good hot butter cuttlefish; craving satisfied!!",1
Good place for gathering. Special for nights. Ladies and children also can visit because there is a small beach area. Friendly service and fast service. But one thing i have to say there is no car park and customers should park their vehicles on the road. The issue is there is a guy collecting money saying he is the person who appointed by barracuda for secure of the vehicles. But when we ask a ticket for the parkings he has nothing to show.,1
"Barracuda is an excellent spot for any gathering! Be it family or friends, everyone can enjoy the ambience of a well place spot by the sea. Enjoy some cool shade during the day and a cool night breeze through the mangroves which shelter the property. The food is absolutely amazing; offering a well made Chinese and Thai Menu, the chefs at Barracuda Sea Food & Grill will not disappoint. Well done and keep up the great work Barracuda Team!!!",1
Great food..enjoyed the live music with the sea viewing experience... you can buy your favourite drinks and enjoy it over there.They don't serve hard drinks. Good for group and family.,1
Good place to have a drink. Bites were decent. Didn't like the Chinese esp the rice.went with children and wasn't happy with the service. But for a couple who likes to be left alone and have a quiet dinner I would say pretty good.,0
Unique place and good sea breeze. Perfect for low light lovers. I would give 6 out of 10 for cleanliness and 5 out of 10 for the quality of food. Friendly and flexible staff.,0
Our go-to place for an excellent Thai Red curry. The Thai beef stir fry is also really tasty. The hot butter cuttlefish was really popular amongst our friends. We wish they served alcohol but they do accept bringing bottles.,1
Great atmosphere and service. Like most venues the live music is too loud. Ask for a table as far away from the stage as possible. You can bring your own booze.,1
"Casual dining on the beach. Reasonable food choice. Naturally, sea food is the focus.",1
Fairly good. Prices are moderate. But it seems little when you even buy the largest potion. But the cost you py is still high. Service is not but not fully satisfied.oders take considerable time to deliver but it might be because its crowded. Prior reservations are highly recommended.,1
"Had my daughter's 14th birthday, function was to start at 6, was there by 5 to get the place ready. None of the function hall ACs working only blowing fam air. No managers to talk. Staff says will take 30 mins to cool. 6 pm still no managers AC still blowing hot air. Had to argue and get the function shifted out doors. Dusty and humid again but no alternative. Party about to start at 6.45. All of a sudden no power to Barracuda only. Everyone except barracuda got power. Staff says generator only to kitchen and cashier. Now 8.15 after more than 2 hours party starts. We have booked the BBQ dinner each costing more than 2000/- per person. Staff bring pre prepared meal from kitchen and put chafing dishes. Light a grill for show only on a side. Food stone cold and unpalatable. Manager has been calling from a couple of days earlier and insisting on the full payment before the day of function after earlier saying that once advance is paid the balance can be paid on the day of the function. No stewards around to clear even a plate. Welcome drink comes with the glass only just above half full. It was a really horrible experience and ruined my daughter's special day. Please avoid at all costs they are only interested in money and not quality or service. Managers unresponsive and not the least friendly once money is paid.",0
Nice and quite place to hang around with friends.. Foods are really good..,0
A good place to hangout with friends for a drink. Food is tasty and I prefer sea side for dining. Not sure whether they still have table on the sea shore.,1
Lovey food and drinks. Specially see foods. Can have privet parties. Restaurant set up near the beach.  Tables are set in open sky place. Night time lovely and can have few hard drinks with your buddy's,1
Very good ambience on the beach. BYOB. Tasty food.,1
"3 words bring me here always- Their HOT BUTTER CUTTLEFISH.
Nuff said.  It's pretty much the only thing I ever order from them.  It's the best!!!
Plus the staff there is pretty decent, polite and helpful.",1
"Battered cuttlefish and other seafood were above very good. Pork dish was below average that your Cheff need more learning on how to do Pork.

Crossing the Railway line to enter the Restaurant is pretty dangerous.

I think entier property is built on unauthorised public beach.",1
Ideal for a romantic dinner out for a couple as well as a bunch of buddies to hang out and booze..excellent food..specially the brownie and the nasi,1
"This was my second visit to Barraacuda. Location is just perfect. Love the set up.The staff was absolutely fantastic. The dinner was lovely & helpful. Most of us vising from abroad felt like we're in heaven when we saw the food. The egg hoppers with the sambol & lunu miris was the lottery of the night. Price is not bad given the quality of the food. All in all, a revisit to this place is never a disappointment. Will be paying a visit again for sure.",1
Everything is really good. Food and it's pretty fast. Except that you have to bring your own booze. We crashed the place to have some beer and they had none.. So we ended up going to the station.,1
Good Place to hangout with Friends & Family. Good atmosphere.,1
"Really Nice restaurant near the beach, foods are great delicious.. Good selection including Chinese, sizzling, Thai etc..",1
Nice place chill with friends  in evening.,1
Nice food and but an amazing view. Has a wide variety of choice including Thai. Moderately expensive though but worth it for a night out,0
Wondering place to spend evening time with Beer and Fries.,1
Food auoerb and no words to explain simply superb but price are high but its a nice place for the friends get together,1
I ordered a daquiri and sizzling fries and mashed potatoes. The daquiri was extremely fresh but my mashed potatoes were cold. There was a live band that sang older rock songs. The service was slow but it's a decent place if you aren't in a hurry and want to enjoy a nice view on the beach.,0
This another in raw of beach side restaurants .you can get a mixed feel of jungle and beach with candles .foods and services are good.in busy days you may not be lucky to get those places near beach mainly Saturday .,1
Very good beach side restaurant in Dehiwala beach. Good environment & clean place. Not shaving alcohol beverages but you can bring from out side.  suitable for beach parties and couples. DJ services also available.,1
"Perfect place for relaxation. Enjoy music, walk-in on shore..",1
Food is good. You may have to wait a little bit of time for your food to get prepared. Prices are reasonable and staff are friendly.,1
Very expensive restaurant. The environment is good but food is okay... Maybe good place for local guys to impress local girls but not really worth visiting if you are a tourist.,0
Excellent foods and service.. portions are also worthy,1
My favorite beach restaurant in Colombo. Ideal place to sit back and have dinner while enjoying seas breezes and view. You'll bake to see sunset in most days.,0
"Kinda strange going to a restaurant that encurages BYOB since they no longer ha a liquor license. But the Food was excellent and it's really nice to sit barefoot on the beach and eat. Definetly an experience, just remember to bring your beverages!",1
"No parking, have to park by the side of the main road in the hot sun and pay as well.
It took a very long time to serve the food.
The main course was tasteless.
The mocktail was good.",0
Lovely place next to the beach. I love their food menu. Almost everything in the menu are great.  Somethings are a bit oily. But u can ask for customizations.,1
Good food # good ambience,1
"Great vibes , good food,  always a good time and you gotta love the view by the beach anyday :)",1
Good place for friends to have a beer and chill,1
"I went here during an off-peak hour and they only had one waiter on staff. The so called YAMU review for hot butter cuttle-fish gave me high expectations of this place. The squid was slightly rubbery giving me an impression that it was not fresh (possibly frozen) the batter was on point. However, overall the taste was average. The scary part of this place is the bill. They have so many variations of taxes to the bill and in the end the price ends up to be rather shocking. I mean seriously why not include all the taxes in the price, its not like any of us are exempt from paying them.",0
"Decent crowd.. Reasonable price for food quantity. Even Small portion of rice dishes are sufficient for 3 person... Better to reserve the table prior to visit, specially on Friday evening..",1
"You can find various types of delicious food and many other stuff here. But the crab doesn't worth the price at all. And as I said before a pace is pricy.
There are some liquor policies in this place.",1
Nice place to have chill out with friends. They not provide alcohol. But you can bring your own bottles have fun .Delicious foods and nice sea beach view.,1
"HORRIBLE service . I ordered chcken soup , garlic toast n limit  & amralla juice . Whn ask from service guy he propose Grill fish. First serve soup n after half n our whn inquire thy bought toast . Nt at all bother . Thn bought grill fush in a sizzle . Nt at all VALUE FOR MONEY. Two very thin fish slices n load of vegetables . No point n appetite gone. Whn gv the feed back to service person he didnt even had impression to hear n no even a minor response . Pathetic service",0
Good food and ambience!!,1
Nice place and reasonable price..,0
Great Location right next to the beach. Nice Ambience. Good Food and cocktail. Service is bit slow,1
"We had this outdoor gathering, great atmosphere. Sense the ocean üåä. The meals and accommodations they provided in finest way. Well served.",1
Normally I go with my family to this place. Preferred for early reservation's. Food taste good. Service is good but bit late when it is crowded. Overall comment is this place is a good place to take your family and to have a good time.,1
Beautiful setting on the beach on a full moon night where we enjoyed the company of friends reunited after many years. The ambience was breathtakingly beautiful and the staff were helpful.,1
"A warm and friendly welcome with fantastic customer service. Always great, tasty food served piping hot- just the way I like it. I would definitely recommend it.",1
Food is good. But outside huts are really hot and they don't have sufficient fans to cater the total floor area. I suffered with my one year old daughter.,0
Lovely place to hang around with friends on a late evening. Good food and ambiance.,1
"Beautiful location, perfect view of the beach and great for sunsets. Food could do with some improvement.",1
Good but not the best,1
"Awesome food, reasonable prices and lovely ambience. The night time ambience is the best. Do be careful when crossing the railway tracks.",1
"These guys have one of the best Hot Butter Cuttlefish .. In general, they have pretty decent food and a lovely environment to chill out. There is a special area for corporate functions too.",1
Poor service. We had to wait in a not at all busy afternoon (there were only 3 tables full) for more than 30 minutes till someone took our order that too after we called out to one of the staff. We asked for a mushroom butter fry appetizer which had more flavouring powders in the batter like someone sprinkeled those flavour packets which come with instant noodles over it.Then the spoon we were given for serving soup was clearly not washed properly. The nightmare didn't end there as last we ordered a seafood combo meal from the grill. The cauliflower was spoilt in the veges they served with it!!! We came out paying 4250/= for waiting too long  and unsanitary food. Needless to say wont be visiting again.,0
"Nice and tasty food, specially the mix grill, staff is friendly but crowded in weekends and Friday night better book before you go.",1
Best thing about barracuda is you don't have to wait long for your food. They're just superfast even if the restuarant is fully packed. And its delicious.,1
Decent place with nice ambiance. More suitable for hangouts and mini get. They don't provide liquor. So you have to bring you own.,1
Do not ever buy barracuda mix Grill.you will receive few bites of chicken pieces and small piece of beef with fried egg and half boil vegetables.its not a grill just a fried. We diliver ed through Uber. Worst meal we had. disappointed!!!!!!!!,0
Friendly service. Recommended,1
Good food and good place to have meet ups with your friends.. opens till very late but food needs to be order by 10.30pm. Vehicles parking can be done on the road.,1
"Average priced place to spend your evening with friends. Seafood items are delicious. I like black peper pork devel among all dishes.
BYOB is fine.",1
Deleacius Food üòã Friendly Service üëçüëçüëç,1
Great place on the beach. Serves superior Thai and Chinese food. Nice to be able to walk around the beach until good is ready. No alcohol serves but you are permited to bring.,1
"Carefully check your bill. I got some list of food that I did not order. The service also not impressed. Food taste are average.
This restaurant do not suitable to get average points more than 4 points.",0
The food is tasty. But while ordering the same dish for the second time the portion is very low. When questioned by us the waiters were not able to answer instead somehow tried to cover it up.,0
I was very disappointed on the attitude of staff of Barakuda. Visited yesterday around 10pm with 5 of my friends. There was no person to set up us a table and finally whn did it was 10:20. It was not a busy day but they were so lazy to take an order n finally said the kitchen is close. Specially the Manager in charge who said he was Narmal. I feel people also reducing gradually coz your staff is not customer friendly..we r high spenders n did not want to destroy our moods coz some useless disappointing unprofessional behaviour by ur staff..i will not recommend or visit with my corporate network in future..im sure urll will close down soon,0
Good place to chill and have some thing delicious.. can do reservation. Friendly staff. Near beach,1
"Good food, reasonably priced, nice place to relax and have a decent meal.",1
"Superb atmosphere. And very good food and BYOB Only reason for the four üåü. The management is really rude, service times and really long. But the view and the atmosphere helps put up with it.",1
"Service was horrible. They didn't have a crowd but yet refused us a table by the beach saying it was too big yet we saw another couple eating at the same big table behind us. Took our business to The Station instead, service was leaps better.",0
"Good beach resturants with choices of sea food dishes..placed on sandy beaches , you can feel thw breeze of sea while tasting a yummy dish of sea food or enjoying a drink with friends.",1
One of the best place in Srilanka where my Wedding reception  memoriable because of this place I visited in 19 February 2015 today is Our 5th Wedding Anniversary.And I am here giving this place 5 Stars and I love the place and their food was delicious deserve hundreds stars from Us üòç,1
Nice place. Bit expensive but worth it in terms of portion size. Dissapointed that they do not take it on themselves to regularly clean the beach infront of of them though.,0
Nice place and nice ambience. However the quality of food and the service has deteriorated overtime. There are many beach front restaurants towards dehiwala that offer value for money service relative to Barracuda.,1
good place to catch-up with friends. food is great. dining under the stars with sound of breaking waves is romantic.,1
"Omg most disgusting place to eat and smoke shisha. I saw a fat ass rat running around and a mangy cat hunting it. Waited 25 mins and asked 6 waiters to have order taken and the place was empty. The drinks are crazy watered down (even  the juices!) The shisha guys have no idea about quality - baccy is dry, they don't maintain the coal (which BTW is the cheap chemical kind) and they charge to replace coal as it dies down instead of having a steady stream of replacements as you smoke. Seriously don't come here - dirty and annoying place to be.",0
Nice food. They have booze too. Tends to be crowded so book your table of you are planing an evening here,1
This place is very good. Foods are delicious. Good place to have meals with family also. Liquor is not available but can bring from outside and consume. Beach is in front.,1

Barracuda is known for its hot butter cuttlefish ( battered cuttlefish with chilliflakes) and its location is ideal with a sea view and option to reserve tables on the private beach.
