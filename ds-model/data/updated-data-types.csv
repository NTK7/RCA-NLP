We had a wonderful Saturday night dinner.,4
They had a fire dancer by the beach and a music band all night.,3
The seafood grill was good and their buttered seafood appetizers were delicious.,1
"The grilled lamb was very chewy and not edible, so I would avoid it if possible.",1
the service was good for a packed restaurant,2
food tasted good.,1
Overall the atmosphere was great,3
the spicy and very diverse menu actually rocks,1
Service was brilliant,2
We had around 15 pax for dinner which we had to reserve 2 days in advance cause they are so busy.,2
They allowed us to bring our cake since we were celebrating and also hard liquor free of charge.,2
They only sell wine and beer.,2
There was a fire dancer who performed and we generally gave him some cash.,3
They set up a table on the beach specially for us.,1
Staff was friendly and accommodating.,2
A nice bar and dining space in Colombo.,3
We can park vehicles in the roadside.,3
Foods are really tasty.,1
"I would like to recommend the soft beverages here, apple juice and lime juice are the best.",1
"At night, there sing gentle songs.",3
They had arranged a special evening which included an entrance fee as well.,2
The restaurant ambiance was good.,3
Our orders came without any delay.,2
But food was not seasoned well and not spicy at all.,1
No enough salt and pepper.,1
Nice place decorated by the natural assets.,3
The sea view and the location is Fantastic for mind peace.,3
Best place for romantic candle light dinners with your loved one.,3
"So many varieties of starters, Noodles, drinks and rice.",1
Liquor also available here.,1
"Taste is so good, for the taste and the quality of the food price can be reasonable.",1
We dropped in for a quick drink and Dirty martini was on point.,1
Tequila sunrise had too much of syrup in it and tasted almost like cordial.,1
"Hot butter prawns were fresh, well prepared, juicey and crunchy at the same time, well deserved 10/10.",1
Great ambience.,3
"Sea breeze, nicely lit,  good music and everything needed for a perfect evening.",3

the prawns were not as big as one might expect.,1

In weekend and friday night specifically you can enjoy live music and dance with tiquila,3
All the foods are so delicious and i love their cocktails.,1
"Beautiful ambiance, right by the ocean.",3
Waitstaff was attentive and helpful.,2
"Beachside seating limited, so we ended up sitting in a more enclosed outdoor area.",3
the live music really tied everything together,3
Food was tasty,1
The food is delicious,1
Gives good music,3
Very interesting place,3
has rapidly emerged as one of the foremost beachside restaurants in the popular Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Beach.,3
"Most evenings will find the restaurant at full capacity, frequented by tourists and locals alike who know Barracuda for our reputation of great service, beachside views, and international cuisines.",4
friendly service from staff.,2
Delicious foods,1
"Recommended for evening parties, day outs and also to celebrate your special occasions.",4
Great place to have some delicious food.,1
"If you are looking for a drink, there's a pub at your service.",1
You can have a nice candle lit dinner near the beach.,3
Went for two pasta dishes and they were really delicious.,1
Food is above average but not so great.,1
My friend wanted to go here but I did not like the atmosphere because all the customers were drunk.,3
The waiters were drunk too because you can smell it when they talk.,2
If you do not drink alcohol like me then you would not like the atmosphere.,3
So unfortunately the experience was not good.,4
The first day I made an order and I was very impressed with the food quality and quantity.,1
The second day I ordered and it was half size even though I ordered large.,1
Called the restaurant and all they did was pass me from person to person and it was not resolved.,2
So the second time the boxes were large as the order was a large but it was mostly empty.,2
So beware its hit and miss with quantity and quality.,1
They lost a potential regular customer for something they could have easily fixed.,2
Not had the greatest experience at my first visit at the end of 2021.,4
The waiter was clearly drunk and messed up our order.,2
He even lost the debit card we used to settle the bill. We found it lying in the floor at the cashier.,2
The food is good.,1
One of the best places for sea food delicacies.,1
Food is delicious,1
and place has nice ambiance.,3
On the beach dining option is available and best during dusk.,3
Band is there to provide live music.,3
This place could get crowded during weekends.,4
Price is not too expensive.,1
Staff is friendly and efficiently provide service.,2
Good place to chill and relax listening to music.,3
the atmosphere is great,3
food is good,1
but the service not as great.,2
The music is too loud and flat out deafening if you did close to the dealers. ,3
"The biggest drawback is the pricing, it is now rediculously expensive.",1
"I ordered hot but got a stew instead, no excuses just constatation they call it hot pot, shame on you guys.",2
Mesmerizing sunset view,3
Awesome food,1
Romantic ambience,3
A must visit place,4
Had a really bad experience ever happened. Really unprofessional service done by them. Never recommend this place anyone. Went with 6 people at 3 pm waited 25 mins and waiters ignored us for some reason even when we called. We went and talked to one of them after and they said they are waiting for a shift change. So we just left after 40 mins of just sitting there. This has never happened anywhere else in Sri Lanka. This was beyond the worst service I thought I had before. Definitely won't go back,2
"It's a generic place for team meetups but the food, service and ambience is the most basic for a beach location.",3
They do have a byob option which is good for people who booze since what's on offer just like the food is a bit on the expensive side.,2
Amazing food.,1
Amazing ambience,3
Everything that we ordered was great.,1
"The must try from our choices were Nasi goreng, Mongolian chicken wings.",1
However the seafood sizzler was priced on the higher side.,1
the overall menu was cost effective as the quantity was sufficient.,1
Good food.,1
Booze is a bit pricey.,1
Service is a bit slow on Friday's and saturdays due to the large crowd but overall nice place to be.,2
A great place to relax with your friends with a few drinks and watch the sunset with your feet in the sand.,3
You can take your own hard liquor without having to pay corkage provided you order enough bites.,2
Live music most nights.,3
Clam place to enjoy the foods.,3
Delicious foods and we can bring our own alcohol and if we buy the foods etc they won't charge extra fee for our bottle.,2
We would like to visit again. Well recommend,4
Good service.,2
Tasty food.,1
Staff very accomodative and friendly.,2
please check your chairs. As the chair I was seated broke and I landed on the sand.,3
"Amazing place, very inviting, the ambience is very soothing given it's on the beach, and some old school music played by a live band.",3
I was told that they got their bar set up now so you can go for nice beer.The food is amazing as well.,1
"If you do everything visit the Barracuda, see if you can get a table out in the beach. It's pretty nice.",3
I just loved this place.,3
Cashews is one of the best dish they serve to vegetarians.,1
Excellent service and value for money.,2
Weekend nights are best to hangout.,3
Horrible customer service. We sat down and ordered two drinks but the waiter just stood there trying to make us uncomfortable and get us to order something more. Then he refused to serve us and said that they will only serve two people if the bill is going to be more than 4000. His tone alone was enough for me to get up and leave.,2
"Quite a good place to have dinner with your loved ones, family and friends. They have table arranged on the open beach as well as in-house. I always prefer the open beach is it gives the feeling of a beach restaurant.",3
The ideal time is after 6.30 when they put on the lights which bring up the romantic mood.,3
You can take your boose from outside as they do not have liquor.,2
Food is average,1
"and service is not up to the expected level. The waiters kind of lazy when we go there. Had to ask a couple of time the same thing. It could be me but generally, it's a good place to spend the evening.",2
Average food. Not so worth for the price.,1
Average washrooms.,2
Three stars only for the friendly waiter.,2
However some of the staff members seem to be drunk during work.,2
Beautiful setting on the beach shade with trees.,3
You can find various types of sea food and many other stuff here.,1
But the cocktails were not good for us and some foods were not worth for the price. Food was expensive.,1
Nice place to have a chill out with friends and family.,3
Finally You will be surprised with bill  (Vat + Service Charge).,2
Food is good,1
Location is good,3
Ambience is good.,3
I must say it was one of the worst experience in terms of making reservations. made multiple calls back and forth to get the correct information for a group reservation.,2
Great spot for dinner,3
We had good food.,1
We had good service,2
The staff were really friendly and helpful and the food arrived within good time.,2
A really nice place for a relaxing dinner with the soft music playing on the background.,3
The dish of the day which was Shanghai Style Fried Noodles with chicken was amazing. A must try. I definitely recommend this place.,1
Good place to have a chilled beer or hard liquor.,1
Location is good and they have nice outdoor seating.,3
Also you can enjoy their meals too. Bit expensive but food and bites are really good,1
Love the experience. The band was amazing.,3

Sea Food is excellent service is quality,1
Barracuda is a well known beach side restaurant in Colombo.,3
We went on a Poya day evening so they didn't have any liquor options.,2
But their mock tails were good. I highly recommend their hot butter cuttlefish. It was so yummy,1
This is a nice place to watch the sun set while zipping a beer.,3
The restaurant start getting crowded after 6.30 or 7 in the evening.,3
Prices are reasonable,1
but staff wasn't fully attending to serve us and we had to give them reminders,2
Lovely place to have your dinner with your family and friends.,3
"Very taste and very hot food, mainly the mixed grill sea food is great.",1
You can bring your own alcohol bottle and use it in the restaurant without any charge.,2
Good sea food variety is available.  Price are reasonable.,1
Very friendly service.,2
View is very good (on the beach). Highly recommended.,3
"Undoubtedly one of the best beach side restuarants in town. Location itself has a great ambiance, specially at night. They have seating inside and outside under the shade of mangroves as well as out in the beach with calming sea breeze. This place is ideal for a hangout and have a drink.",3
Service at barracuda is top notch owing to the wonderful staff who are friendly and attentive. Service is fast too.,3
"Their menu is pretty extensive and all the dishes we tried were absolutely great while hot butter cuttlefish which was crispy and crunchy, not too spicy and fried to perfection here stands out from the rest as the best. Similarly hot butter prawns, devilled pork and indonesian style chicken accompanied by a creamy gravy was pretty good too. Rice and noodles dishes didnt have any artificial flavours so their taste was enhanced with the other dishes we tried. Sizzling Mixed meat grill and sea food grill were worth the price as they contained plenty of items in it. Judging from the portion size,quality and taste the dishes were absolutely worth the price.",1
"Excellent place that i have visited. The hotel outside covered with trees and we can sit and have fun under those trees. We'll have functions, parties on this hotel. There we can arrange tables on the seashore too. We could see the sun set at the evening time very clear.",3
"Yesterday, we had a disappointing experience at Barracuda Restaurant. We were planning to spend the entire night at Barracuda upon seeing the pictures, until the moment we left as soon as we experience a bad time. Not just the service was very slow, we were mislead by the servers to think that the Mixed Grill plater will have plenty of meat items. Unfortunately, when the food arrived, it was barely enough for 1 person because it had 1 sausage, couple of small pieces of liver, 1 half boiled egg and other burnt meat underneath which we couldn't figure out what it was and the half of the plater was covered in vegetables.We immediately requested the manager at that it was around 6:30 pm. When the manager arrived, we were surprised to see how he was acting. I don't know whether this gentleman was under the influence of alcohol or what, but clearly he was not responsive with answers.When we asked the manager, why in the menu it clearly says meat plater and the meat mentioned is clearly described in plural form as in sausages etc but in reality it was just 1 sausage. His response was this is the standard size whether you like it or not.Then I ask do you really think this mixed grilled meat plater is enough for 3 people as your server described. His response was, ""I can give you more vegetable or salad to cover up the lose"".So I immediately said to the manager, what you are doing is very bad. You gave the impression that we will get a load of meat but the portion of mixed grill plater worth Rs. 3200 is only enough for 1 person. It is unfair and unjust. We didn't want this incident to ruin our mood and destroy our night so we immediately requested for Bill, paid and left.While we were leaving the server and security asked us to make a review so the owner apparently, Gihan Bandara would read this and take it seriously.",2
For love of God please avoid this place at all cost. There are better places next to this establishment which take care of the customers way better and at a reasonable cost. I have attached the receipt of the bill and picture of the plater.I feel like we got scammed. I will never come to this place and I will make sure that my friends avoid Barracuda as well.,2
I got a chance to spend that evening together with her. Wow place. anyone will be warmly welcomed by Baracuda but food wasn't up to my expected standard. Calm quiet sandy beach and whistling wind gave us life. Moreover they're really concerned about our safe side..for that they already have guards even to check whether there's trains coming on railway.to confirm safety when crossings.,3
No parking space available. You just have to park along the road.,2
Service was very bad and we had to wait so long to order.,2
We have asked them to arrange a table for our anniversary celebration but it wasn't arranged. Too bad service.,2
"First of all I wanted to find good place, watch LPL Cricket Match while having my dinner. As I have had Cricket practices in the afternoon, wanted to sip a beer. Alas ! No Corona. I mean the beer. However they had an offer during LPL. That is for 4 pints of Heineken for 1200/- nett., ordered that along with my vegetarian dinner. A steamed rice, 4 variety of mushroom chopsuey kind of dish. I felt five star. The bartender is also a nice guy.",2
Very decent place. Women group are also enjoying. But beware of Trains when you go back.,3
Great location next to the beach. But it is not a high end place. The food and beer is good. The staff is courteous but service not exactly quick.,3
The entrance is quite odd. You need to cross railway tracks to get into the restaurant.,3
"Overall, not a based place to spend the evening",3
Nice place to chill in the evening with frends and familly. Place is decorated with beautifull lighting and seating arrangement. Bar and band music are available. Mount lavinia beach is adjacent to this place with plesent scenery.,3
"This has been serving wonderful Thai, Chinese and grilled seafood for almost 4 years now.",1
"The ambience is just what you need to relax your mind and enjoy a hearty meal. It's a restaurant situated amidst screw pine trees. The view that you see is that of the sea and  the sky changing with time, adding color to the experience. The chairs are set under the trees, under sheds and also on the coast.Dinner is served under candle light and also fire torches lighting the sand.",3
The food is on point. The perfect dishes with probably the best chefs. Hot butter cuttlefish is one of their expertise. The sweet corn soup is lovely and fills your heart. The main dishes are mouthwatering and the best in Dehiwala.,1
The staff are very friendly and professional. They greet you with a smile and are always ready to make the stay comfortable.,2
Earlier they did not serve alcoholic beverages but the customers were allowed to bring in their own. Now they've started serving alcohol.,2
There's ample amount of parking on the Marie drive guarded by the restaurant management.,2
It's better to reserve a table over the phone before visiting it as it's mostly packed.,3
but the staff is downright rude. On several occasions this had happened. Shows the lack of training.,2
Superb place to spend an evening. Beach side single restra. Ample amount of lights and sea wave sounds with deliciously good food.,3
Prawns Fried Rice & Thai Red Curry we had along with local drink - Arrack,1
The restaurant is situated in a beautiful and a calm place.,3
The staff is very friendly and always available to support you.,2
The food is great and personally I loved it. The liquor is served after 5 pm. The prices are little bit expensive but reasonable.,1
"Also, you can go for a walk in the beach as the restaurant is situated adjecent to the beach as well. So that is a bonus point. I recommend this place.",2
Foods is average.,1
They got about one hour to serve fried rice.,1
It also without chillie paste and sause. I dont whats the reason.,1
Before 2years they had suprb service.,2
"Great experience. Excellent customer service and food, located right on the beach.",2
Good place to have a little chilling time.,3
Food is expensive but small in  portion  and not much tasty.,1
But good ambience.,3
View and the atmosphere was so good,3
Delicious foods & Prices are also reasonable,1
"Great customer service, Friendly staff, Very helpful",2
Very good ambience. Great views of the ocean and has a clean beachfront to chill and take a stroll.,3
"They also have a happy hour from 5p.m. to 7p.m. so if you are going out to have few drinks and chill out, definitely recommend the place.",2
"Food wise,they have a reasonably priced menu, the one we got was crispy calamari with chillie  sauce.The calamari was itself was good",1
"but the sauces were a let down as we got served with tomato ketchup were not spicy and their special orange sauce. This one was a joke of sort as they used sunquick as their orange flavor. NOPE. They said they mixed sunquick with the other ingredients to mix the sauce but I honestly felt like they jist served us concentrated sunquick as a sauce. Other than that, it was very nice.",1
Staff is friendly and acommodating. Wold visit again.,2
"Had 2 seafood platters, baked crab and hot butter cuttlefish, a steak and a few other dishes When food is not seasoned properly it's absolutely vile. All the vegetables that came with the food was spoiled. Broccoli zucchini and cauliflower and the mashed potato Probably days old. No stars is not an option here hence the one star. You can done in a five star hotel for the prices they charge. 25 k for rubbish.",1
"Most messed up place ive visited. Walked around for 15 minutes when I got there looking for a place to dine, the waiters dont care and when i finally asked a waiter for help he told me that i should go find the manager and ask him where we should sit? Where in the world does this happen? These guys have no idea what they're doing and look totally lost. All you see is them running around. Took them 30 minutes just to get us beer mugs, we actually had to walk in the kitchen and get it since we got sick of waiting just on mugs. Seems like the staff got no idea on what they need to do. This place also has no covid precautions, just a tap near the gate. After all this me and my friends just wanted to leave. God knows what goes in their food. You get better service anywhere else guys.",2
One of my all time favorites.,1
"However, during my last visit I felt that the quality of the food is little low than before.",1
But still tasty. Dishes are really good. I prefer Hot butter cuttlefish.,1
Note that prices are higher. Cuttlefish large costed around 1200 LKR without other taxes (Extra taxes around 23%).,1
Liquors are not available you have to bring it from outside.,2
Ambience is super cool for dinners,3
the food is really good and worth for the price,1
but the customer service is very very very poor !!! Hope they provide a good customer service  next time. we had to wait hours to get the menu,2
This is a great place to have a drink and get some really amazing sea food. Ordered the buttered cuttlefish and curry leaf prawns. And also got Singaporean chill crab and prawn marinara. Really good place to eat as it's on the beach.,1
Really good place to have nice seafood meal. Seating available in the beach itself. Nice ambiance.,3
"Awesome place to have a drink, have very good food and hang around, you can take your own bottle from outside, no cokeage if you buy food.",3
A beach restaurant with a nice ambience.,3
Cool and shady outdoor dining even during the day time regardless of it being right next to the beach which is mostly exposed to scorching sun.,3
Good food especially sea food.,1
One of the best seafood restaurants by the beach BYOB food is quite good with lot of cusine choices.,1
crowded usually. Try to reserve a table otherwise you will have to wait.,2
"Live music ,sand under your feet. Sea breeze with good food. Great place.",3
However the place can be too crowded at times and might have to stay longer than you expect to place an order,2
Perfect service and fast food within 15 min after order. This is the only place I experienced in the Colombo suburb that much of speedy service to fulfill our order.,2
Food was also tasty.,1
The one who served us also good gentlemen and did his best to serve us.,2
Only matter was food prices.,1
The service was above average,2
the ambience was very good,3
the food was palatable.,1
"On behalf of all of us at Businessfocus360, we would like to thank the team at Barracuda Seafood and Grill for a fantastic and memorable evening held on the 10th of April 2021. I can assure you that everyone enjoyed the ambience at the function area",3
we were thrilled at the overall service given to us by your staff members.,2
"Moreover, the food was absolutely delectable and well worth for the price we paid.",1
"We would also like to extend a big thank you out to the manager Mr. Beed, who truly went above and beyond to meet all our specific requirements. Mr. Beed was not only very accommodating but managed to exceed our expectations in terms of executing the function beautifully. Likewise, we would like to extend our appreciation out to Anjana; our waiter for the night as well as the in-house gardener who assisted us with the decorations and the post clean-up. Your efforts will never be forgotten by our team.",2
We wish team Barracuda nothing but the very best in their future endeavours and we hope to host many more events together with them soon.,2
Had wonderful time and the surrounding was awesome.,3
Food the Barracuda are really yummy.,1
But there BBQ was not a real-time one. That is one concern and then they didn't allow to take excess food which we had paid already.,2
Other than that everything was fine. They arranged to get us a Karaoke even which was somewhat ok.,3
A knowledgeable service.,2
Fresh and delicious food. Reasonably priced and got many varieties. Worth the wait,1
the view is great.,3
I am a frequent visitor to this place .Love the new hut on the beach.,3
Menu wise my favourite is salt & pepper cuttlefis and pork belly,1
Nice place and awesome sea view. Five stars from me and recommend for anyone who thinking or planning for parties or get togethers or day outings.,2
"Nice atmosphere, beachfront property , outside dining. Tasty food and good service.",3
"Recommended place for a peaceful evening out. I had awesome dinner with my loved ones. I would really like to visit this place again. I can recommend this place to any body who like to enjoy Delicious food, Live music , Sea view with good customer service.",3
"nice and quite place for anyone, families, friends, couples. environment is so nice.",3
foods are good. all the things under a reasonable price.,1
"the only thing is, Crows , because it's an almost open area. but no harm.",3
Great place to hang around have a drink and chill by the beach.,3
Quality of foods is good but the portion size for the price is a bit less. Overall good experience.,1
It was a pleasant evening with fresh sea food and live music.,3
Foods are tastefully freshly made and try to sizzler corner but get more on thai menu.,1
Prices are quite moderate but worth for the money.,1
hot butter cuttlefish was extraordinary. Little bit Expensive.,1
But Nice Environment near the beach.,3
Great Food and Drinks Selection.,1
If you go for lunch expect disturbing flies since seated out near the beach.,3
professional staff,2
I would give 4 stars for a dinner out when the flies are sleeping,3
One of the popular spots on the beach to unwind and have a drink by the water.,1
It's a BYOB place and food is extremely reasonable and delicious.,1
Great for a romantic dinner with your loved one or for group of friends,3
Service could be little better but the fact they are always full explains the delay. Total chill spot worth trying out,2
Love the food here.Good variety.,1
"However, there are lot of flies around.",3
Requested staff to move our food inside. Very helpful staff indeed.,2

Nice atmosphere.,3
However the menu has not changed much over the years,2
I enjoyed the atmosphere,3
Food is really good.,1
Hot butter cuttle fish tastes good,1
Dishes are authentic.,1
Waiters are friendly,2
but difficult to find them for re-orders as they were too busy due to crowd. Demand to take beach side chairs.,2
Bit expensive for budget guys,2
Super chilled out place for a dinner with boyb.,3
Not the best seafood,1
amazing abiance.,3
Delicious food.,1
The menu has a big variety of food.,1

Once I organized a dinner party for about 60 guests and the staff was helpful and gave me a really good service.,2
The setting of the restaurant and the location is nice. Highly recommended.,3
tasty food and welcoming staff,2
Seafood grilled platter must try and butter cuttlefish,1
"Chill place in evening time, foods are very delicious, and staff servents also friendly.",2
Nice place to hang out with family and friends.,2
Beach outside sitting is available only after 6pm since its a public beach area. Inside sitting is well planned.,3
Food is good and priced well. Portion quantity was also good. Can bring your own bottles.,1
Overall this is a good place to hang out.,3
"We ordered a small seafood fried rice and a spicy rice chicken for 4 people but one portion is more than enough because they give is huge portions. Crispy prawn balls were nice as a starter and hot butter calamari amazing, others were regular tastes. We also ordered sex on the beach, Cinderella, virgin Mary and gummy bear. The taste of virgin Mary needs to improve and sex on beach and gummy bear was nice.",1
We were lucky enough to get a seat outside facing beach. But it's always better to put a reservation if possible before going.,3
Live music and good tasty food on the beach under the trees. Well set up and done nicely. Very energetic place with access to family and youngster. Trendy and decent place with great vibes.,3
Staff is attentive and provides an efficient service.,2
Food is absolutely delicious and prepared taking not too long.,1
Customers are allowed to bring in their own booze without being charged for corkage. Prices are moderate.,2
Great place next to sea. Great for dinner,1
"Will enjoy with live dj & sea wind  but they serving too spicy, better you take ice cream as desert",3
Went for a dinner in February 2019 here. Experience was so good. Has a nice view of the beach. Can access the beach area.,3
"Had french fries, prawns and chicken for side dishes. Those were so fresh and tasty. Had sea food rice, noodles and chicken with gravy. Those too were good.",1
Has a good service.,2
Nice cosy seaside restaurant and bar.,3
Great seafood options to go with your drinks.,1
A great place to hangout. Nice and friendly staff with good service.,2
a great environment for a lovely evening.,3
Food is really good.,1
Even the service is really good. ,2
They are having customised options too. Staff is very friendly.,2
Great seafood with variety of choices.,1
Clean and calm environment suitable for any age groups but gets crowded in the weekend so reserve a table beforehand. Beach view is beautiful and you can bring alcohol here they only serve meals and bites and sandy. Perfect place for a romantic dinner by the beach. Affordable prices and portions are pretty big too.,3
I specially likes the malasiyan style sea food noodles and hot butter cuttlefish.,1
It is the best place for everyone to hangout with friends and family,3
Service is superb and there are no body to disturb our free time,2
"Food is good, but little expensive.",1
"In front of the beach & right beside the Colombo Galle rail track,  therefore make sure to be extra careful. Ortherwise it's ok",3
Baraccuda's service has become meh compared to last year. waiters just give excuses when we request for seating arrangements in distance even when there is no reserved tables neither no much crowd. Most importantly I didn't see they are sanitizing the tables after each use.  They just clean the stuff on the table to ground though a cloth and never see they practice hygiene while working around. I only see a handwashing and a thermometer near entrance with security who direct us to wash hands. but no QR code option but on the other hand the food prices have gone up which is acceptable if they are practicing the health requirements and service well to maintain the cleanliness.,2
I agree on cost of changes in some food items but not all affect. it was like  unfair when ordering for two. even though we need to order several items we cannot think of it due to the same high flat rate applied to all items. portions are well served for groups but not for two. one of my favorite place but feeling disappointed. not recommended especially during covid spreading environment like this. hope they will improve.,1
Good location by the sea and dining tables arrange on the beach and under mangrove. Very good place for family dining or with friends. Good live music and perfect atmosphere for a relaxing drink and food. Restaurant doesn't serve any alcohol drinks but you can take your own drinks with you. There is no corkage only for Beer and wine. If you are visiting the place you need to try hot butter cuttlefish which is one of their specialty,3
It's recommend that you booked a table prior to your visit because this restaurant is always crowded specially in weekends.,2
"I don't liked at all, the most important things that the waters are not professional and rude and the food to serve to you table is to late.",2
No that great like those days. Had a very bad experience with the mixed grills recently. Quantity is also very poor for the cost,1

Super friendly staff.,2
They have good cocktails and mocktails,1
The ambience is amazing and the food is good too.,3
This is very nice to dine at nights. There are seats my beach side too.,3
Oh boy this is a bad place to be. They had good food and a stage service. Now it's extremely bad service and average or eleven lesser food. Orders not take properly.  Late to serve. So the food is cold. It's bad not recommended to anyone.,2
Has the sea breeze and calm atmosphere for a dinner. Suitable for large groups of friends or families with kids.,3
"Has the basic food, appetisers and range of drinks. Food is good ",1
an average service.,2
Since this is an outdoor restaurant they can't avoid the flies 100% but they can reduce by not collecting all the finished plates in one table and keeping them forever,3
"This is the one of best beach restaurant at dehiwala, mount Lavinia, it locates beautiful sea front garden and nice location, specially for birthday parties , friends get togethers , they are providing good service and delicious food you can Oder many more seafood and take tables by the beach and enjoy with evening",3

Fantastic food and ambience.,3
Must go for just the seafood and lamb chops.,1

Food also good.  Variety of Mocktails available.,1
 No corkage if u buy the bites in-house. ,2

Food are OK.,1
food was delicious.,1
Very nice and helpful waiters.,2
 Ratio between price and value is good.,1
 They dont have liquor but beer cans can be brought in free. Liquor bottles can also be bought in but a charge of 1500 rupees per bottle should be paid.,4
 Overall the prices are a bit high,1
the background and vibes are just perfect for a tranquil night,3
"The food is also scrumptious along with a variety of delicious drinks. I prefer the ""sex on the beach"" drink which was jist awesome",1
A jazz musician plays his trumpet to entertain guests and he does it really well.,3
we requested fish fillet in Thai sauce but what they bought is Kind of deviled fish,2
 But little bit crowded.,4
Ordered a Cherry Cola mocktails and the spicy seafood rice. Food and drinks was good,1
however service was poor. We had to wait nearly 30 minutes until a waiter noticed us and we could give our order. And even afterwards it took another 15 minutes to bring the drinks,2
"I have been here several times, and keep going back for more.",4
Love the ambience,3
Love the menu and the staff and the service.,2
"Great place to hangout with friends, specially after work.",4
Nice location,3
but the problem was poor customer service. They have not enough staff to serve to customers.,2
Dined yesterday (28th),4
as usual the food was scrumptious.,1
Great entertainment too. Loved the band,3
Great place to enjoy the evening with beach restaurant.,3
Worst at everything,4
Customer service is so low they took one hour to bring a water bottle,2
the seafood rice was a junk,2
It's always the best veiw,3
"double check the bill before paying, they add extra meals for the bill without even serving",2
love the layouts,3
people who serve you with pleasure,2
Good restaurant near beach,3
best for night,3
tasty food,1
high price but it's some worth,1
high class look,3
I'm happy about that place,3
Good place to hang out. My favourite place.,4
Choose the table on the beach ( sandy area ) and not inside. It's more relaxing outside with the breeze.,4
The music was very nice,3
the waiter Roshan was very friendly and good,2
The food was amazing. We ordered Nasi Goreng it was a big portion but the taste was fantastic and we also ordered Chicken Alfredo Pasta which was very creamy and delicious.,2
Alcohol is slightly higher priced but over all a great.,1
memorable experience,4
Waiters were really humble and professional service was given.,2
Best to go as a group of friends or for a nice romantic date night,4
One of the best places for sea food lovers. Super tasty foods to enjoy.,1
Awesome place next to the beach,3
"good food, huge portion size",1
Service is a tad bit slow though,2
One of the nice place to spend your dinner time with your family.,4
Amazing sea view and brezz.,3
Just try it out one day. Stay safe,4
This is my first visit to Barracuda.,4
Atmosphere is superb,3
food is superb,1
service is superb,2
The quantity and quality of the food is spot on.,1
I recommend this place to anyone.,4
Great place to have fresh seafood by the beach.,1
A bit pricey though.,1
One of the best place to hangout with friends and family,4
great music and great sea breeze,3
if you can go by around 4pm 4.30pm,4
better if you can prebook and go there,4
can take liquor from outside and if Bill goes greater than 12k the corkage free if not corkage will be around 1000 to 1500,4
great place to hangout,4
except for the fact of crossing the railway,4
The food was great and well worth the price.,1
The place borders the beach.,3
"Ambience is pretty good too, if you don't mind the sound of the occasional train.",3
Better reserve the table first after giving a call to them.,4
The ideal time is the evening.,4
The beach is quite dirty at the other side.,3
 you will experience great view of sunset,3
The food is lil bit pricy. Recomanded.,1
Ordered a small portion of batter fried cuttlefish and a mixed grill. Cuttlefish fish was good,1
but the mixed grill was really bad.,1
Half of the meat was gizzard and chicken liver which seemed cheap and the vegetables tasted old.,1
told our waiter about the vegetables and to pass the message to the chef but got no feedback or any kind of response from the chef.,2
You guys should have a much better mixed grill,1
You guys should have at least better customer service,2
Amazing experience. ,4
Tasty Foods.,1
In Sri Lanka terms this is a budget sea front restaurant if u want to take your own booze.  ,4
 The place has a fairly decent beach front.,3
The ambience is good and also quite private.,3
Food is average at best and it's best to keep it at finger foods,1
"You have to be careful when you get to this place, as you have to go across the railway line.  The place got to much publicity when two teenagers who were careless crossed the railway and were run over by a train.  Since then the venue management has added more security who will blow the whistle and watch over as you cross the railway.",4
Superb sea food restaurant.   ,4
Crab green curry is yummy and recommend.,1
Chinese and Thai food served .,1
No bar. But you can take your own liquor.,1
 Yummy food . ,1
 Friendly staff. ,2
Take long time to arrange the order .,2
Little bit crowded.,4
"This is by far one of my favorite places to eat in Colombo, Sri Lanka.  I make it a point to visit here every time I come to Sri Lanka for a visit.",4
" Right off the beach, live music,It was amazing.",3
 The service is great and very friendly! Just LOVE it!!!,2
Calm and quiet place to have a lunch..,3
Interesting place considering that I am from the States... Had to walk over some train tracks to get to the front door.. but once inside... wow... what a cool place! ,3
We actually ate on the beach.. and you walk under a canopy of trees to get to the tables. I really enjoyed it.... ,3
 good customer service,2
Oh and the butter mushroom appetizer was awesome  ! Check it out !,1
This place is amazing. I had an amazing time here. customers can enjoy freely here.,4
 this place has a great ocean view. ,3
Very chilled out place for alfresco dining under the cover of trees and fairy lights.,3
 There is a Chinese menu and sizzler grill menu. ,1
 Ideal couples place in the evening but also had families there as well. ,4
 I have eaten a lot of Chinese food and this is up there with some of the Malaysian Chinese food I have eaten (never been to China or Hong Kong),1
"We tried the Chinese menu and the portions are big, fresh and delicious.",1
There is a no singing and dancing policy which we found hard to keep to as there was live sax music playing popular tunes at the time. ,4
Friendly and attentive waiters.,2
Awesome food. ,1
Very nicely presented and tasty as well. ,1
One of the best Phad Thai Goong and Red Curry I've ever had. ,1
Clean and very nice atmosphere. :),3
slow service,2
Good food ,1
" The only good thing about the hotel was they have lots of varieties including Chinese,  Japanese and thai food.",1
Service is also good and better reserve as it can be busy at nights but during day it's not that busy…,2
Good place to chill with a ice cold glass of beer…,4
Not suitable for family or kids because staffs don't know how to respect their customers.,2
Don't waste your money on the sweet n sour lobster.,3
"Would recommend the tables on the beach. Better do a reservation prior, in order to get a decent table.",1
Nice BYOB place.,4
suitable for children - they are quite entertained by the beach!,3
 Service for tables on the beach is available only after 6.,2
Go a bit early and enjoy a fabulous Colombo sunset over the ocean. Its a lovely stretch of as yet unspoiled beach.,3
We ordered Lasagna for kids but it was cold. ,1
"I've seen people celebrating b'days, proposals, anniversaries etc. It serves liquor, so sometimes it can be a bit crowded and loud.",4
A nice break out of  but still in Colombo. Near location for a quick beach side outing and lunch for kids.,4
Good location easy drive down the marine drive from Colombo.,4
They also offer corkage free of charge for liquor bottles. so you can take any number of bottles freely. Still you have to buy bites from them.,4
"The only reason I am giving one less star is the fact you have to cross the rail tracks to enter the hotel, I found that quite interesting.",4
 Food is very good.,1
Good place for sea food.,1
There is no dedicated parking space here.,4
 Nice place to have a chill out with friends and family.,4
" If you are going there to drink you can take alcohol from outside and if your bill is more than 14,000 they won't charge corkage... ",4
 They offer large portions of food at a reasonable price. Highly recommended.,1
 It started raining and we at the beach table getting wet.  Hotel doesn't have any measures to mitigate.  ,2
Despite the efforts of the Buddhist government to stop alcohol usage on poya day they were serving alcohol without any restrictions.,4
 Despite the beach and sea wind it was smelling bad. ,3
Music was monotonous. ,4
 Will always love to go there for Thai or Chinese. Keep it up :),1
Nice place,4
Very good seafood grill. Highly recommended,1
Service was very poor.  They didn't even provide paper tissues and water to the tables.  ,2
"Good place to enjoy an evening with friends, good food amazing beach and friendly service.",4
Food here is good and reasonably priced…,1
One of the super place located in Dehiwala. It has a nice view of the beach as well. ,3
Great environment by the ocean. ,3
A chilled place right at a very convenient location. Been there a multiple times. Beach front. ,3
This place is ideal to have an evening meal with your friends. ,4
Had the chicken fried rice and some fish and a dry dish.  Food quality was good. ,1
Good place if you are looking for a beach restaurant with beach hut atmosphere in Colombo. ,3
Wanted a relaxing evening but it spoilt by the staff. When we complained about food their reaction were rude and aggressive. Didn't apologise for their fault or we could not meet the manager. ,2
Atmosphere was great ,3
 Food is really nice,1
food and cocktails were below average. ,1
 but takes ages to get the attention of a staff members to order something.,2
Had I been on familiar turf I would have refused to pay for the meal.  When I expressed my dissatisfaction to the maitre d' I was told the poor quality was my waiters fault(absurd).,2
" portion sizes are very small, consisting mainly of rice and fried cabbage.",1
Prices are on par with mixed grill restaurants around the world,1
The black pepper chicken also good but too much oil pieces instead of meat.,1
 Specially the hot butter cuttle fish. Is the best I had. ,1
 Has to wait for a long time to order and even to get cutlery sometimes.  ,2
Because of the very poor service standards I don't wanna go there again,2
Food is yummy.,1
 day by day their service is getting worse.,2
Has several 'mini' locations that can accommodate the public as well as small private functions at the same time.,4
 They have both indoor and outdoor areas available. ,3
Great food.,1
 if this place were busy I'm assuming the service would be much slower.,2
I still recommend this place as a four star location as the menu is huge and has alot of options. ,1
At any rate its still worth your time.,4
Good service,2
Highly recommended for beach chill out.,3
 This place have best coustomer service.,2
Overall meat platter tasted disgusting.,1
We couldnt eat it and just left the place feeling sick in our stomachs. ,1
"French fries were like rubber, hard and chewy. ",1
Vegetables tasted like they were cooked in sewer water and meat was hard and tasted like rubber.,1
Meat platter was 70% vegetables and meat was mostly chicken liver and gizzards which was ridiculous.  ,1
Unprofessional Staff behavior.,2
There is 10% service charge and 12% Vat to your bill,4
Food portions are very low comparing to nearby similar beach restaurants,1
 Food quality is disappointing when comparing to the price,1
Quick Service,2
"Try their hot butter cuttlefish! Also love their thai green veg curry, indonesian chicken curry and sizzlers.",1
Great place to meet with friends and family .  ,4
Great location and Ambiance,3
Just had the worst meat platter we've ever had.,1
Friendly staff ,2
 Food is delicious,1
This place have awesome foods and shisha. ,1
"They serve kan kung with grass in it , no apologise even though we showed it to manager... i rest my case there......",2
Good food. ,1
"Wow what to say... Portions lets start there, the small vermicelli chicken (Thai menu) was huge. It could easily feed 3ppl even for American portions. It was cooked how you'd expect and we kept digging in. ",1
Pretty chilled out atmosphere.  This place is right on the beach.,3
Place is super nice. ,3
Amazing atmosphere.,3
Nice and ambiance to chille out..,3
This is not a restaurant for those who appreciate good food.  Avoid at all costs.,1
Exceptionally poor quality seafood.  ,1
Ladies and children also can visit because there is a small beach area.,4
Thank you so much for making the celebration a wonderful experience.  Definitely consider Barracuda for a memorable experience of Sri Lanka.,4
  yummy hot butter cuttlefish! ,1
Walked in craving a good hot butter cuttlefish; craving satisfied!!,1
 The buffet and desserts were perfect. ,1
 waiter staff awesome,2
The view awesome.,3
We were initially hesitant to order the hot buttered cuttlefish as part of our set menu - although both Janeesha and Dinesh urged us to try it as it is their signature dish.  Well. we were not disappointed. It truely is the best dish.,1
Be careful when crossing the railway with kids if you're taking any.,4
Parking is done along the main road yet is safe. ,4
Many foreigners who love a shisha and a chat along with a nicemeal comes here. ,1
 The vegetable salad was out of this world.,1
"I found Chinese, Thai and seafood menus where I chose a vegetarian meal. The food was good.",1
The service is nicer.,2
The restaurant among the trees is also nice. ,3
"Although you have to use the beach at your own risk, I'd recommend it very much. ",3
 The breeze is so romantic that even couples could dine decently and then enjoy a little bit of the beach.,3
The hidden place along the gake road towards Dehiwala is quite ideal for friends and family who fancy a good meal facing the sea.,4
We held a function on Sunday 17/3/2019 for 35 people.  Dinesh and Janeesha were very accommodating even offering to help a few guests over the train tracks due to walkers and mobility issues. So dont let the train tracks stop you from going to this amazing beautiful place.,2
Beautiful place ,3
 sorry to say service is really poor. give some training to staff so they will make customers happy.,2
"Quick service.The staff was friendly and it's open 11 am to 11 pm, so coming in at an odd hour in between is no problem. ",2
We have booked the BBQ dinner each costing more than 2000/- per person. Staff bring pre prepared meal from kitchen and put chafing dishes. Light a grill for show only on a side.,4
Welcome drink comes with the glass only just above half full.,1
 Food stone cold and unpalatable. ,1
 the quality of the food has reduced.The Grilled Menu is very disappointing now.,1
No stewards around to clear even a plate. ,2
"Plus the staff there is pretty decent, polite and helpful.",2
Moderately expensive though but worth it for a night out,4
Crossing the Railway line to enter the Restaurant is pretty dangerous.,4
Pork dish was below average that your Cheff need more learning on how to do Pork.,1
Tasty food.,1
 Foods are really good..,1
Managers unresponsive and not the least friendly once money is paid.,2
 Please avoid at all costs they are only interested in money and not quality or service.,2
 It was a really horrible experience and ruined my daughter's special day. ,4
 Service is not but not fully satisfied.orders take considerable time to deliver but it might be because its crowded. Prior reservations are highly recommended.,2
But one thing i have to say there is no car park and customers should park their vehicles on the road. The issue is there is a guy collecting money saying he is the person who appointed by barracuda for secure of the vehicles. But when we ask a ticket for the parkings he has nothing to show.,4
Like most venues the live music is too loud. Ask for a table as far away from the stage as possible.,3
We wish they served alcohol but they do accept bringing bottles.,4
Friendly and flexible staff.,2
 I would give 6 out of 10 for cleanliness and 5 out of 10 for the quality of food.,1
Well done and keep up the great work Barracuda Team!!!,4
 Enjoy some cool shade during the day and a cool night breeze through the mangroves which shelter the property. ,3
Good place to have a drink. Bites were decent.,4
Didn't like the Chinese especially the rice.,1
 Good for group and family.,4
enjoyed the live music with the sea viewing experience.,4
"The food is absolutely amazing; offering a well made Chinese and Thai Menu, the chefs at Barracuda Sea Food & Grill will not disappoint. ",1
Good place for gathering. Special for nights.  Friendly service and fast service. ,2
"Barracuda is an excellent spot for any gathering! Be it family or friends, everyone can enjoy the ambience of a well place spot by the sea.",3
 you can buy your favourite drinks and enjoy it over there.They don't serve hard drinks.,4
 went with children and wasn't happy with the service. But for a couple who likes to be left alone and have a quiet dinner I would say pretty good.,2
Unique place and good sea breeze. Perfect for low light lovers. ,3
Our go-to place for an excellent Thai Red curry. The Thai beef stir fry is also really tasty. The hot butter cuttlefish was really popular amongst our friends. ,1
"Casual dining on the beach. Reasonable food choice. Naturally, sea food is the focus.",1
Fairly good. Prices are moderate. But it seems little when you even buy the largest potion. But the cost you pay is still high.,1
"Had my daughter's 14th birthday, function was to start at 6, was there by 5 to get the place ready. None of the function hall ACs working only blowing fam air. No managers to talk. Staff says will take 30 mins to cool. 6 pm still no managers AC still blowing hot air. Had to argue and get the function shifted out doors. Dusty and humid again but no alternative. Party about to start at 6.45. All of a sudden no power to Barracuda only. Everyone except barracuda got power. Staff says generator only to kitchen and cashier. Now 8.15 after more than 2 hours party starts. ",2
Nice and quite place to hang around with friends..,4
A good place to hangout with friends for a drink. ,4
Lovey food and drinks. Specially see foods. ,1
Very good ambience on the beach. ,3
"3 words bring me here always- Their HOT BUTTER CUTTLEFISH.
It's pretty much the only thing I ever order from them.It's the best!!!",1
Battered cuttlefish and other seafood were above very good. ,1
Food is tasty and I prefer sea side for dining.,1
Can have privet parties. Restaurant set up near the beach.  Tables are set in open sky place. Night time lovely and can have few hard drinks with your buddy's,4
The egg hoppers with the sambol & lunu miris was the lottery of the night. ,1
Price is not bad given the quality of the food. ,1
Well served.,2
Reasonable price for food quantity. Even Small portion of rice dishes are sufficient for 3 person.,1
nice sea beach view.,3
"The scary part of this place is the bill. They have so many variations of taxes to the bill and in the end the price ends up to be rather shocking. I mean seriously why not include all the taxes in the price, its not like any of us are exempt from paying them.",4
" The so called YAMU review for hot butter cuttle-fish gave me high expectations of this place. The squid was slightly rubbery giving me an impression that it was not fresh (possibly frozen) the batter was on point. However, overall the taste was average. ",1
you can ask for customizations.,4
 Somethings are a bit oily. ,1
Almost everything in the menu are great.,1
 I love their food menu.  ,1
The environment is good ,3
 food is okay.,1
 Maybe good place for local guys to impress local girls but not really worth visiting if you are a tourist.,4
It took a very long time to serve the food.,2
The main course was tasteless.,1
The mocktail was good.,1
in busy days you may not be lucky to get those places near beach mainly Saturday .,4
  The service was slow but it's a decent place if you aren't in a hurry and want to enjoy a nice view on the beach.,2
There was a live band that sang older rock songs.,4
" foods are great delicious.. Good selection including Chinese, sizzling, Thai etc..",1
Everything is really good. Food and it's pretty fast. ,1
The staff was absolutely fantastic.,2
 The dinner was lovely & helpful. Most of us vising from abroad felt like we're in heaven when we saw the food. ,1
"All in all, a revisit to this place is never a disappointment. Will be paying a visit again for sure.",4
Ideal for a romantic dinner out for a couple as well as a bunch of buddies to hang out and booze.,4
This was my second visit to Barraacuda. Location is just perfect. Love the set up.,3
Except that you have to bring your own booze. We crashed the place to have some beer and they had none.. So we ended up going to the station.,4
Good Place to hangout with Friends & Family. Good atmosphere.,3
Really Nice restaurant near the beach.,4
Nice place chill with friends  in evening.,4
Nice food. Has a wide variety of choice including Thai. ,1
Wondering place to spend evening time with Beer and Fries.,4
Food superb and no words to explain simply superb but price are high,1
I ordered a daquiri and sizzling fries and mashed potatoes. The daquiri was extremely fresh but my mashed potatoes were cold.,1
This another in raw of beach side restaurants .you can get a mixed feel of jungle and beach with candles .,3
Very good beach side restaurant in Dehiwala beach. Good environment & clean place. Not serving alcohol beverages but you can bring from out side. ,4
"Perfect place for relaxation. Enjoy music, walk-in on shore..",3
You may have to wait a little bit of time for your food to get prepared. ,1
Very expensive restaurant. ,4
Excellent foods and service.. portions are also worthy,1
My favorite beach restaurant in Colombo. Ideal place to sit back and have dinner while enjoying seas breezes and view. You'll bake to see sunset in most days.,3
"Kinda strange going to a restaurant that encourages BYOB since they no longer has a liquor license. But the Food was excellent and it's really nice to sit barefoot on the beach and eat. Definetly an experience, just remember to bring your beverages!",4
"No parking, have to park by the side of the main road in the hot sun and pay as well.",4
Lovely place next to the beach.,3
good ambience,3
"Great vibes , always a good time and you gotta love the view by the beach anyday :)",3
Good place for friends to have a beer and chill,4
I went here during an off-peak hour and they only had one waiter on staff.,2
"Decent crowd.. Better to reserve the table prior to visit, specially on Friday evening..",4
You can find various types of delicious food and many other stuff here.,1
Nice place to have chill out with friends. ,4
 But the crab doesn't worth the price at all. And as I said before a pace is pricy.,1
There are some liquor policies in this place. They not provide alcohol. But you can bring your own bottles have fun . ,4
Service is bit slow,2
Nice place and reasonable price..,4
Great Location right next to the beach. Nice Ambience. ,3
Good Food and cocktail. ,1
"We had this outdoor gathering, great atmosphere. Sense the ocean. The meals and accommodations they provided in finest way. ",3
Normally I go with my family to this place. Preferred for early reservation's. Service is good but bit late when it is crowded. Overall comment is this place is a good place to take your family and to have a good time.,4
Beautiful setting on the beach on a full moon night where we enjoyed the company of friends reunited after many years.,3
 The ambience was breathtakingly beautiful and the staff were helpful.,3
A warm and friendly welcome with fantastic customer service. ,2
"Always great, tasty food served piping hot- just the way I like it. I would definitely recommend it.",1
 outside huts are really hot and they don't have sufficient fans to cater the total floor area. I suffered with my one year old daughter.,3
Lovely place to hang around with friends on a late evening. Good ambiance.,3
"Beautiful location, perfect view of the beach and great for sunsets. ",3
Food could do with some improvement.,1
Good but not the best,4
"Awesome food, reasonable prices. ",1
 The night time ambience is the best.,3
These guys have one of the best Hot Butter Cuttlefish.,1
" In general, they have a lovely environment to chill out. There is a special area for corporate functions too.",3
Poor service. We had to wait in a not at all busy afternoon (there were only 3 tables full) for more than 30 minutes till someone took our order that too after we called out to one of the staff.,2
 We asked for a mushroom butter fry appetizer which had more flavouring powders in the batter like someone sprinkeled those flavour packets which come with instant noodles over it.Then the spoon we were given for serving soup was clearly not washed properly. ,1
The nightmare didn't end there as last we ordered a seafood combo meal from the grill. The cauliflower was spoilt in the veges they served with it!!! ,1
We came out paying 4250/= for waiting too long  and unsanitary food. Needless to say wont be visiting again.,4
"Nice and tasty food, specially the mix grill.",1
staff is friendly but crowded in weekends and Friday night better book before you go.,2
Best thing about barracuda is you don't have to wait long for your food. They're just superfast even if the restuarant is fully packed. And its delicious.,2
Decent place with nice ambiance. More suitable for hangouts and mini get. They don't provide liquor. So you have to bring you own.,4
Do not ever buy barracuda mix Grill.you will receive few bites of chicken pieces and small piece of beef with fried egg and half boil vegetables.its not a grill just a fried. We delivered through Uber. Worst meal we had. disappointed!!!!!!!!,1
Friendly service. Recommended,2
Good food and good place to have meet ups with your friends. ,4
opens till very late but food needs to be order by 10.30pm. ,4
Average priced place to spend your evening with friends. Seafood items are delicious. I like black peper pork devel among all dishes.,1
Serves superior Thai and Chinese food. ,1
Great place on the beach. Nice to be able to walk around the beach until good is ready. ,3
Carefully check your bill. I got some list of food that I did not order. The service also not impressed. ,2
Food taste are average.,1
while ordering the same dish for the second time the portion is very low. When questioned by us the waiters were not able to answer instead somehow tried to cover it up.,2
I was very disappointed on the attitude of staff of Barakuda. Visited yesterday around 10pm with 5 of my friends. There was no person to set up us a table and finally whn did it was 10:20. It was not a busy day but they were so lazy to take an order n finally said the kitchen is close.  ,2
I feel people also reducing gradually coz your staff is not customer friendly..,2
we r high spenders n did not want to destroy our moods coz some useless disappointing unprofessional behaviour by ur staff.,2
i will not recommend or visit with my corporate network in future..im sure you all will close down soon,4
Good place to chill and have some thing delicious..,4
"Good food, reasonably priced, nice place to relax and have a decent meal.",1
Superb atmosphere.  But the view and the atmosphere helps put up with it.,3
"The management is really rude, service times and really long.",2
"Service was horrible. They didn't have a crowd but yet refused us a table by the beach saying it was too big yet we saw another couple eating at the same big table behind us. Took our business to The Station instead, service was leaps better.",2
Good beach resturants with choices of sea food dishes.,1
"placed on sandy beaches , you can feel the breeze of sea and enjoying a drink with friends.",3
I am here giving this place 5 Stars and I love the place and their food was delicious deserve hundreds stars from Us ,1

Dissapointed that they do not take it on themselves to regularly clean the beach infront of of them though.,3
Nice place and nice ambience. ,3
good place to catch-up with friends.  ,4
However the quality of food and the service has deteriorated overtime. There are many beach front restaurants towards dehiwala that offer value for money service relative to Barracuda.,4
dining under the stars with sound of breaking waves is romantic.,3
Omg most disgusting place to eat and smoke shisha. I saw a fat ass rat running around and a mangy cat hunting it. ,4
 Seriously don't come here - dirty and annoying place to be.,4
"The drinks are crazy watered down (even  the juices!) The shisha guys have no idea about quality - baccy is dry, they don't maintain the coal (which BTW is the cheap chemical kind) and they charge to replace coal as it dies down instead of having a steady stream of replacements as you smoke.",1
Waited 25 mins and asked 6 waiters to have order taken and the place was empty. ,2
Tends to be crowded so book your table of you are planing an evening here,4
Good place to have meals with family also. ,4
Good place for outdoor dining,3
" even the menu is very small, few grillers and so",1
" too loud music, one of d worst places to spend the evening",3
"Don't ever go on a Saturday, worst customer service ever, they take more than one hour to deliver a French fries, when call they say no reservations needed, n we go, there is no table,",2
Food is okay but very pricey!!!,1
 Some staff not wearing masks.,2
Unreasonable prices for food,1
A gem in Colombo. One of the best seafood spots with a great view of the ocean. Live music and the lanterns make you fall in love with food.,3
Beverages are perfect.,1
 Some food tastes artificial flavours. ,1
New year evening DJ is zero. Its like some audio recording is playing.,4
"Poor service, delaynin serving feel me like not to go again",2
 you can eat Sri Lankan style BBQ and sea food items. Taste is not bad at all. Tax seems more for me.,1
I will never come to this place.bad service.,2

Waiter smells so bad ! Sweat smell everywhere! Waiters should wear deodorant ! I feel like vomiting now.,2

Difficult make loud noises ( Music bands/DJs) because of Nabour complains. ,4

However it was only broken by the very near by train tracks.,4
Barracuda is known for its hot butter cuttlefish ( battered cuttlefish with chilliflakes) and its prices are reasonable,1

 Only minus is the safety where it's located opposite railway tracks with no protection.,4
