The second day I ordered and it was half size even though I ordered large.,0,1

A must visit place,1,4
Had a really bad experience ever happened. Really unprofessional service done by them. Never recommend this place anyone. Went with 6 people at 3 pm waited 25 mins and waiters ignored us for some reason even when we called. We went and talked to one of them after and they said they are waiting for a shift change. So we just left after 40 mins of just sitting there. This has never happened anywhere else in Sri Lanka. This was beyond the worst service I thought I had before. Definitely won't go back,0,2
"It's a generic place for team meetups but the food, service and ambience is the most basic for a beach location.",1,3

Cashews is one of the best dish they serve to vegetarians.,1,1
Excellent service and value for money.,1,2
Weekend nights are best to hangout.,1,3
Horrible customer service. We sat down and ordered two drinks but the waiter just stood there trying to make us uncomfortable and get us to order something more. Then he refused to serve us and said that they will only serve two people if the bill is going to be more than 4000. His tone alone was enough for me to get up and leave.,0,2
"Quite a good place to have dinner with your loved ones, family and friends. They have table arranged on the open beach as well as in-house. I always prefer the open beach is it gives the feeling of a beach restaurant.",1,3
The ideal time is after 6.30 when they put on the lights which bring up the romantic mood.,1,3
You can take your boose from outside as they do not have liquor.,0,2
Food is average,0,1
"and service is not up to the expected level. The waiters kind of lazy when we go there. Had to ask a couple of time the same thing. It could be me but generally, it's a good place to spend the evening.",0,2
Average food. Not so worth for the price.,0,1
Average washrooms.,0,2
Three stars only for the friendly waiter.,0,2
However some of the staff members seem to be drunk during work.,0,2
Beautiful setting on the beach shade with trees.,1,3
You can find various types of sea food and many other stuff here.,1,1
But the cocktails were not good for us and some foods were not worth for the price. Food was expensive.,0,1

"Undoubtedly one of the best beach side restuarants in town. Location itself has a great ambiance, specially at night. They have seating inside and outside under the shade of mangroves as well as out in the beach with calming sea breeze. This place is ideal for a hangout and have a drink.",1,3
Service at barracuda is top notch owing to the wonderful staff who are friendly and attentive. Service is fast too.,1,3
"Their menu is pretty extensive and all the dishes we tried were absolutely great while hot butter cuttlefish which was crispy and crunchy, not too spicy and fried to perfection here stands out from the rest as the best. Similarly hot butter prawns, devilled pork and indonesian style chicken accompanied by a creamy gravy was pretty good too. Rice and noodles dishes didnt have any artificial flavours so their taste was enhanced with the other dishes we tried. Sizzling Mixed meat grill and sea food grill were worth the price as they contained plenty of items in it. Judging from the portion size,quality and taste the dishes were absolutely worth the price.",1,1
"Excellent place that i have visited. The hotel outside covered with trees and we can sit and have fun under those trees. We'll have functions, parties on this hotel. There we can arrange tables on the seashore too. We could see the sun set at the evening time very clear.",1,3
"Yesterday, we had a disappointing experience at Barracuda Restaurant. We were planning to spend the entire night at Barracuda upon seeing the pictures, until the moment we left as soon as we experience a bad time. Not just the service was very slow, we were mislead by the servers to think that the Mixed Grill plater will have plenty of meat items. Unfortunately, when the food arrived, it was barely enough for 1 person because it had 1 sausage, couple of small pieces of liver, 1 half boiled egg and other burnt meat underneath which we couldn't figure out what it was and the half of the plater was covered in vegetables.We immediately requested the manager at that it was around 6:30 pm. When the manager arrived, we were surprised to see how he was acting. I don't know whether this gentleman was under the influence of alcohol or what, but clearly he was not responsive with answers.When we asked the manager, why in the menu it clearly says meat plater and the meat mentioned is clearly described in plural form as in sausages etc but in reality it was just 1 sausage. His response was this is the standard size whether you like it or not.Then I ask do you really think this mixed grilled meat plater is enough for 3 people as your server described. His response was, ""I can give you more vegetable or salad to cover up the lose"".So I immediately said to the manager, what you are doing is very bad. You gave the impression that we will get a load of meat but the portion of mixed grill plater worth Rs. 3200 is only enough for 1 person. It is unfair and unjust. We didn't want this incident to ruin our mood and destroy our night so we immediately requested for Bill, paid and left.While we were leaving the server and security asked us to make a review so the owner apparently, Gihan Bandara would read this and take it seriously.",0,2
For love of God please avoid this place at all cost. There are better places next to this establishment which take care of the customers way better and at a reasonable cost. I have attached the receipt of the bill and picture of the plater.I feel like we got scammed. I will never come to this place and I will make sure that my friends avoid Barracuda as well.,0,2
I got a chance to spend that evening together with her. Wow place. anyone will be warmly welcomed by Baracuda but food wasn't up to my expected standard. Calm quiet sandy beach and whistling wind gave us life. Moreover they're really concerned about our safe side..for that they already have guards even to check whether there's trains coming on railway.to confirm safety when crossings.,1,3
No parking space available. You just have to park along the road.,0,2
Service was very bad and we had to wait so long to order.,0,2
We have asked them to arrange a table for our anniversary celebration but it wasn't arranged. Too bad service.,0,2
"First of all I wanted to find good place, watch LPL Cricket Match while having my dinner. As I have had Cricket practices in the afternoon, wanted to sip a beer. Alas ! No Corona. I mean the beer. However they had an offer during LPL. That is for 4 pints of Heineken for 1200/- nett., ordered that along with my vegetarian dinner. A steamed rice, 4 variety of mushroom chopsuey kind of dish. I felt five star. The bartender is also a nice guy.",1,2
Very decent place. Women group are also enjoying. But beware of Trains when you go back.,1,3
Great location next to the beach. But it is not a high end place. The food and beer is good. The staff is courteous but service not exactly quick.,1,3
The entrance is quite odd. You need to cross railway tracks to get into the restaurant.,0,3
"Overall, not a based place to spend the evening",0,3
Nice place to chill in the evening with frends and familly. Place is decorated with beautifull lighting and seating arrangement. Bar and band music are available. Mount lavinia beach is adjacent to this place with plesent scenery.,1,3
"This has been serving wonderful Thai, Chinese and grilled seafood for almost 4 years now.",1,1
"The ambience is just what you need to relax your mind and enjoy a hearty meal. It's a restaurant situated amidst screw pine trees. The view that you see is that of the sea and  the sky changing with time, adding color to the experience. The chairs are set under the trees, under sheds and also on the coast.Dinner is served under candle light and also fire torches lighting the sand.",1,3
The food is on point. The perfect dishes with probably the best chefs. Hot butter cuttlefish is one of their expertise. The sweet corn soup is lovely and fills your heart. The main dishes are mouthwatering and the best in Dehiwala.,1,1
The staff are very friendly and professional. They greet you with a smile and are always ready to make the stay comfortable.,1,2
Earlier they did not serve alcoholic beverages but the customers were allowed to bring in their own. Now they've started serving alcohol.,1,2
There's ample amount of parking on the Marie drive guarded by the restaurant management.,1,2
It's better to reserve a table over the phone before visiting it as it's mostly packed.,0,3
but the staff is downright rude. On several occasions this had happened. Shows the lack of training.,0,2
Superb place to spend an evening. Beach side single restra. Ample amount of lights and sea wave sounds with deliciously good food.,1,3
Prawns Fried Rice & Thai Red Curry we had along with local drink - Arrack,1,1
The restaurant is situated in a beautiful and a calm place.,1,3
The staff is very friendly and always available to support you.,1,2
The food is great and personally I loved it. The liquor is served after 5 pm. The prices are little bit expensive but reasonable.,1,1
"Also, you can go for a walk in the beach as the restaurant is situated adjecent to the beach as well. So that is a bonus point. I recommend this place.",1,2
Foods is average.,1,1
They got about one hour to serve fried rice.,0,1
It also without chillie paste and sause. I dont whats the reason.,0,1
Before 2years they had suprb service.,0,2
"Great experience. Excellent customer service and food, located right on the beach.",1,2
Good place to have a little chilling time.,1,3
Food is expensive but small in  portion  and not much tasty.,0,1
But good ambience.,1,3
View and the atmosphere was so good,1,3
Delicious foods & Prices are also reasonable,1,1
"Great customer service, Friendly staff, Very helpful",1,2
Very good ambience. Great views of the ocean and has a clean beachfront to chill and take a stroll.,1,3
"They also have a happy hour from 5p.m. to 7p.m. so if you are going out to have few drinks and chill out, definitely recommend the place.",1,2
"Food wise,they have a reasonably priced menu, the one we got was crispy calamari with chillie  sauce.The calamari was itself was good",1,1
"but the sauces were a let down as we got served with tomato ketchup were not spicy and their special orange sauce. This one was a joke of sort as they used sunquick as their orange flavor. NOPE. They said they mixed sunquick with the other ingredients to mix the sauce but I honestly felt like they jist served us concentrated sunquick as a sauce. Other than that, it was very nice.",0,1
Staff is friendly and acommodating. Wold visit again.,1,2
"Had 2 seafood platters, baked crab and hot butter cuttlefish, a steak and a few other dishes When food is not seasoned properly it's absolutely vile. All the vegetables that came with the food was spoiled. Broccoli zucchini and cauliflower and the mashed potato Probably days old. No stars is not an option here hence the one star. You can done in a five star hotel for the prices they charge. 25 k for rubbish.",0,1
"Most messed up place ive visited. Walked around for 15 minutes when I got there looking for a place to dine, the waiters dont care and when i finally asked a waiter for help he told me that i should go find the manager and ask him where we should sit? Where in the world does this happen? These guys have no idea what they're doing and look totally lost. All you see is them running around. Took them 30 minutes just to get us beer mugs, we actually had to walk in the kitchen and get it since we got sick of waiting just on mugs. Seems like the staff got no idea on what they need to do. This place also has no covid precautions, just a tap near the gate. After all this me and my friends just wanted to leave. God knows what goes in their food. You get better service anywhere else guys.",0,2
One of my all time favorites.,1,1
"However, during my last visit I felt that the quality of the food is little low than before.",0,1
But still tasty. Dishes are really good. I prefer Hot butter cuttlefish.,1,1
Note that prices are higher. Cuttlefish large costed around 1200 LKR without other taxes (Extra taxes around 23%).,0,1
Liquors are not available you have to bring it from outside.,0,2
Ambience is super cool for dinners,1,3
the food is really good and worth for the price,1,1
but the customer service is very very very poor !!! Hope they provide a good customer service  next time. we had to wait hours to get the menu,0,2
This is a great place to have a drink and get some really amazing sea food. Ordered the buttered cuttlefish and curry leaf prawns. And also got Singaporean chill crab and prawn marinara. Really good place to eat as it's on the beach.,1,1
Really good place to have nice seafood meal. Seating available in the beach itself. Nice ambiance.,1,3
"Awesome place to have a drink, have very good food and hang around, you can take your own bottle from outside, no cokeage if you buy food.",1,3
A beach restaurant with a nice ambience.,1,3
Cool and shady outdoor dining even during the day time regardless of it being right next to the beach which is mostly exposed to scorching sun.,1,3
Good food especially sea food.,1,1
One of the best seafood restaurants by the beach BYOB food is quite good with lot of cusine choices.,1,1
crowded usually. Try to reserve a table otherwise you will have to wait.,0,2
"Live music ,sand under your feet. Sea breeze with good food. Great place.",1,3
However the place can be too crowded at times and might have to stay longer than you expect to place an order,0,2
Perfect service and fast food within 15 min after order. This is the only place I experienced in the Colombo suburb that much of speedy service to fulfill our order.,1,2

"Moreover, the food was absolutely delectable and well worth for the price we paid.",1,1

We wish team Barracuda nothing but the very best in their future endeavours and we hope to host many more events together with them soon.,1,2
Had wonderful time and the surrounding was awesome.,1,3
Food the Barracuda are really yummy.,1,1
But there BBQ was not a real-time one. That is one concern and then they didn't allow to take excess food which we had paid already.,0,2

A knowledgeable service.,1,2

Clean and calm environment suitable for any age groups but gets crowded in the weekend so reserve a table beforehand. Beach view is beautiful and you can bring alcohol here they only serve meals and bites and sandy. Perfect place for a romantic dinner by the beach.

"In front of the beach & right beside the Colombo Galle rail track,  therefore make sure to be extra careful. Ortherwise it's ok",0,3
Baraccuda's service has become meh compared to last year. waiters just give excuses when we request for seating arrangements in distance even when there is no reserved tables neither no much crowd. Most importantly I didn't see they are sanitizing the tables after each use.  They just clean the stuff on the table to ground though a cloth and never see they practice hygiene while working around. I only see a handwashing and a thermometer near entrance with security who direct us to wash hands. but no QR code option but on the other hand the food prices have gone up which is acceptable if they are practicing the health requirements and service well to maintain the cleanliness.,0,2
I agree on cost of changes in some food items but not all affect. it was like  unfair when ordering for two. even though we need to order several items we cannot think of it due to the same high flat rate applied to all items. portions are well served for groups but not for two. one of my favorite place but feeling disappointed. not recommended especially during covid spreading environment like this. hope they will improve.,0,1
Good location by the sea and dining tables arrange on the beach and under mangrove. Very good place for family dining or with friends. Good live music and perfect atmosphere for a relaxing drink and food. Restaurant doesn't serve any alcohol drinks but you can take your own drinks with you. There is no corkage only for Beer and wine. If you are visiting the place you need to try hot butter cuttlefish which is one of their specialty,1,3
It's recommend that you booked a table prior to your visit because this restaurant is always crowded specially in weekends.,0,2
